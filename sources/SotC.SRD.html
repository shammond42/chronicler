<p>You’ll need a few supplies along with these rules to play the game. Here’s a
list of mandatory items, as well as some recommended ones.</p>
<p>You’ll <strong>need</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Four Fudge Dice for each player and the GM. If you don’t have Fudge dice,
see Grey Ghost Games (www .fudgerpg .com) or your local RPG dice supplier
for a pack, or just substitute regular six sided dice.</li>
<li>Some copies of character sheets or at least blank paper to record
characters.</li>
<li>Writing implements.</li>
<li>Friends. (For running a game, the sweet spot’s somewhere between
two and six. For creating characters, the more the better – the more
folks you have with characters, the easier it will be to put together a
game whenever you feel like it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find <strong>useful</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A set of poker chips or glass beads (to use as fate points).</li>
<li>Index cards to pass notes and to make notes on things that come up
in play.</li>
<li>Snacks.</li>

<p>Most things in the system are rated according to the ladder below (when we say
<strong>“the ladder”</strong> throughout the text, this is what we mean).  Usually, the
adjectives are used to describe things – someone might be a Good Pilot or Poor
at Academics. The adjectives and numbers are interchangeable, so if a player
or GM is more comfortable with numbers, it is equally valid to say Pilot: +3 or
Academics: -1. The best compromise is often to use both, as in a Pilot: Good
(+3) or a Academics: Poor (-1).  On this scale, Average represents the level of
capability that someone who does something regularly and possibly
professionally, but not exceptionally.</p>

<p>Most people are Average at the things they do for a living, like Science for a
scientist, and are Mediocre or Poor at most other things. It is only when they
are driven to excel that they surpass those limits.</p>
<p>Pulp heroes push the very boundaries of what “normal” people are capable of,
and as such, they tend to be Superb at whatever their central passion is. This
means that pulp heroes are genuinely exceptional individuals, and are
frequently recognized as such.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id149" id="rolling-the-dice" name="rolling-the-dice">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling the Dice</a></h2>
<p>Whenever a player rolls dice, he rolls four Fudge dice (abbreviated as 4dF) to
generate a result between -4 and 4. When reading the dice, a + equals +1, a -
equals -1 and a 0 equals 0. Some example dice totals are shown to the right.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Sample Dice Totals</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>⊟ ⊞ ⊟ ⊟  =  -2</li>
<li>+000  =  +1</li>
<li>0+0-  =   0</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The total of the dice is then added to an appropriate skill to get a result.
This result can be referred to as the <strong>effort</strong> made, but sometimes, it’s just
“the result”.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>If you find yourself without Fudge dice, then roll 4 six-sided dice. Any die
showing a 1 or 2 is treated as -, and any die showing a 5 or 6 is treated as +.</p>
</div>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id150" id="difficulty" name="difficulty">1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty</a></h2>
<p>When a character rolls for a result, he is trying to meet or exceed a target
value, which is the <strong>difficulty</strong> for the roll. The difficulty indicates how
hard it is to do something. Difficulties are measured on the same ladder as
everything else. For instance, it might be a Mediocre (+0) difficulty to
jumpstart a car, but a Good (+3) difficulty to repair that same car after a
serious breakdown. Guidelines for setting difficulties are found in the GM’s
section of the book.</p>
<p>The difference between the difficulty and the result of the roll (the effort)
is the magnitude of the <strong>effect</strong>, which is measured in <strong>shifts</strong>. Shifts are
used, primarily by the GM, to determine the potency of a character’s efforts
and to govern the resolution of complex actions. We’ll talk about shifts more
in the coming chapters.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id151" id="skills" name="skills">1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills</a></h2>
<p>Characters have <strong>skills</strong>, like Drive and Guns, which are rated on the ladder
(page XX). Considered on the most basic level, skills represent what your
character can do. When a character rolls the dice, he usually is rolling based
on his skill.</p>
<p>Nearly every action that the character might undertake is covered by his
skills. If he doesn’t have a skill on his sheet, either because he didn’t take
it or the skill itself doesn’t exist, it is assumed to default to Mediocre.</p>
<p>Skills are covered in greater detail in their own chapter, beginning on page
XX.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id152" id="aspects" name="aspects">1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspects</a></h2>
<p>Characters also have a set of attributes called <strong>aspects</strong>. Aspects cover a
wide range of elements and should collectively paint a picture of who the
character is, what he’s connected to, and what’s important to him (in contrast
to the “what can he do” of skills).</p>
<p>Aspects can be relationships, beliefs, catchphrases, descriptors, items or
pretty much anything else that paints a picture of the character. Some possible
aspects are shown here.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Sample Aspects</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Quick Witted</li>
<li>Sucker for a Pretty Face</li>
<li>Rough &amp; Tumble</li>
<li>Dapper Devil</li>
<li>Stubborn Like a Mule</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For many, many more examples see the aspects section starting on page XX.  An
aspect can be used to give you a bonus when it applies to a situation.  Doing
this requires spending a fate point (see below). In this capacity, called
invoking an aspect, it makes the character better at whatever it is he’s doing,
because the aspect in some way applies to the situation (such as “Dapper” when
trying to charm a lady).</p>
<p>An aspect can also allow you to gain more fate points, by bringing
complications and troubling circumstances into the character’s life.  Whenever
you end up in a situation where your aspect could cause you trouble (such as
“Stubborn” when trying to be diplomatic), you can mention it to the GM in the
same way you mention an aspect that might help you. Alternately, the GM may
initiate this event if one of your aspects seems particularly apt. In either of
these two cases, this is called <strong>compelling an aspect</strong>, and its effect is
that your character’s choices are limited in some way. If the GM initiates or
agrees to compel the aspect, you may get one or more fate points, depending on
how it plays out.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about fate points shortly.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id153" id="stunts" name="stunts">1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunts</a></h2>
<p>Stunts are those things that a character can do which stretch or break the
rules. They are the special tricks the character has up his sleeves. Stunts
have very specific uses and rules, and are detailed extensively in their own
chapter (page XX). Starting characters will have five stunts.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id154" id="fate-points" name="fate-points">1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate Points</a></h2>
<p>Every player begins the first session of the game with a number of <strong>fate
points (FP)</strong> equal to how many aspects he has, usually ten. Fate points give
players the ability to take a little bit of control over the game, either by
giving their character bonuses when they feel they need them, or by taking over
a small part of the story. Fate points are best represented by some non-edible
token, such as glass beads or poker chips. (Previous experiments with small
edible candies have left players strapped for points!)</p>
<p>Characters may, at any point, spend a fate point to gain a bonus, invoke an
aspect, tag an aspect, make a declaration, or fuel a stunt.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Gain a Bonus</dt>
<dd>A fate point can be spent to add 1 to any roll of the dice, or improve any
effort (such as an attack or defense) by 1. In practice, this is the least
potent way to use a fate point – you’re usually much better off using one of
the other applications, below. (Most games get rid of this rule once their
players get comfortable using aspects; you can, too .)</dd>
<dt>Invoke an Aspect</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Aspects (see above, page XX) are those things that really describe a
character and his place in the story. When you have an aspect that’s
applicable to a situation, it can be invoked to grant a bonus. After you have
rolled the dice, you may pick one of your aspects and describe how it applies
to this situation.  If the GM agrees that it’s appropriate, you may spend a
fate point and do one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reroll all the dice, using the new result, or</li>
<li>Add two to the final die roll (after any rerolls have been done).</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">You may do this multiple times for a single situation as long as you have
multiple aspects that are applicable. You cannot use the same aspect more
than once on the same skill use, though you may use the same aspect on
several different rolls throughout a scene, at the cost of one fate point per
use.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Tag an Aspect</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Scenes, other characters, locations, and other things of dramatic importance
can have aspects. Sometimes they’re obvious, and sometimes they’re less so.
Players can spend a fate point to invoke an aspect which is not on their own
character sheet, if they know what the aspect is.  This is referred to as
tagging an aspect, and is covered in greater detail in the Aspects chapter,
on page XX.</p>
<p class="last">As a rule of thumb, tagging someone or something else’s aspects requires a
little more justification than invoking one of your own aspects. For scene
aspects, it should be some way to really bring in the visual or theme that
the aspect suggests. For aspects on opponents, the player needs to know about
the aspect in the first place, and then play to it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Power a Stunt</dt>
<dd>Some stunts have particularly potent effects, and require spending a fate
point when used. If a stunt requires a fate point to be spent, it will be
made clear in the description. See the section on stunts (page XX) for more.</dd>
<dt>Make a Declaration</dt>
<dd><p class="first">You may simply lay down a fate point and declare something. If the GM accepts
it, it will be true. This gives the player the ability to do small things in
a story that would usually be something only the GM could do.</p>
<p>Usually, these things can’t be used to drastically change the plot or win a
scene. Declaring “Doctor Herborn drops dead of a heart attack” is not only
likely to be rejected by the GM, it wouldn’t even be that much fun to begin
with. What this can be very useful for is convenient coincidences. Does your
character need a lighter (but doesn’t smoke)? Spend a fate point and you’ve
got one! Is there an interesting scene happening over there that your
character might miss? Spend a fate point to declare you arrive at a
dramatically appropriate moment!</p>
<p>Your GM has veto power over this use, but it has one dirty little secret. If
you use it to do something to make the game cooler for everyone, the GM will
usually grant far more leeway than she will for something boring or, worse,
selfish.</p>
<p class="last">As a general rule, you’ll get a lot more leniency from the GM if you make a
declaration that is in keeping with one or more of your aspects. For example,
the GM will usually balk at letting a character spend a fate point to have a
weapon after he’s been searched. However, if you can point to your “Always
Armed” aspect, or describe how your “Distracting Beauty” aspect kept the
guard’s attention on inappropriate areas, the GM is likely to give you more
leeway. In a way, this is much like invoking an aspect, but without a die
roll.</p>

<p>Players usually regain fate points between sessions when a <strong>refresh</strong> occurs.
If the GM left things at a cliffhanger, she is entitled to say that no refresh
has occurred between sessions. By the same token, if the GM feels that a
substantial (i.e., dramatically appropriate) amount of downtime and rest occurs
in play, the GM may allow a refresh to occur mid-session.</p>
<p>The amount of fate points a player gets at a refresh is called his <strong>refresh
rate</strong> and it is usually equal to the number of aspects the player has. When a
refresh occurs, players bring their number of fate points <strong>up to</strong> their
refresh rate. If they have more, their total does not change.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id156" id="earning-new-fate-points" name="earning-new-fate-points">1.8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earning New Fate Points</a></h3>
<p>Players earn fate points when their aspects create problems for them. When this
occurs, it’s said that the aspect <strong>compels</strong> the character. When the player
ends up in a situation where his compelled aspect suggests a problematic course
of action, the GM should offer the player a choice: He can <em>spend</em> a fate point
to ignore the aspect, or he can act in accordance with the aspect and <em>earn</em> a
fate point. Sometimes, the GM may also simply award a fate point to a player
without explanation, indicating that an aspect is going to complicate an
upcoming situation. Players can refuse that point and spend one of their own to
avoid the complication, but it’s not a good idea, as that probably means the GM
will use things that <em>aren’t</em> tied to you.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>This isn’t just the GM’s show; players can trigger compels as well either by
explicitly indicating that an aspect may be complicating things, or by playing
to their aspects from the get-go and reminding the GM after the fact that they
already behaved as if compelled.  The GM isn’t always obligated to agree that a
compel is appropriate, but it’s important that players participate here. See
the Aspects chapter on page XX for a more detailed treatment of compels.</p>

<p>While players have the leeway to explore any ideas that interest them, it’s
worth remembering that the pulps have a handful of easily recognizable
character types. While you are far from obliged to fit characters into these
neat little “boxes”, we encourage you to create characters that match the
overall flavor. Beyond that, you’re free to fill in details as you like. A pulp
setting can support characters of almost every stripe, but there are a few
common themes worth taking a look at.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id160" id="academic" name="academic">2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic</a></h3>
<p>The academic lives somewhere between the scientist and the explorer. The
academic is compelled by his interest in his field, which is usually something
like history, linguistics, anthropology or (most famously) archaeology. The
academic knows that lost, hidden, and forgotten knowledge exists all over the
world. Ancient ruins, obscure libraries, mysterious artifacts – all these can
offer answers to questions that have not even been asked yet.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You are answering questions, finding what was lost, and trying to expand the breadth of human knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id161" id="explorer" name="explorer">2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explorer</a></h3>
<p>Though much of the map of the world is filled in, much of it remains blank or
is simply wrong. The explorer thrives on discovering who and what is in those
unknown places. The khaki-clad, pith-helmeted image of the explorer is perhaps
the most compelling, but the same spirit can beat in the hearts of ship
captains, spelunkers, or even ambassadors.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re discovering the world, opening new doors and
seeking lost secrets and treasures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id162" id="gadget-guy" name="gadget-guy">2.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gadget Guy</a></h3>
<p>The gadget guy is the recipient of the wonders of science. He is the keeper of
a unique piece of technology, usually at the behest of its creator. The creator
may or may not still be alive and serving as a patron for him (and in some
cases, the creator and the gadget guy are the same person!). The device in
question is usually quite potent, and serves as a signature for the character –
something interesting and immediately recognizable, like a jet pack, a super
car, or an exotic weapon.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> With great technology comes great responsibility.  Your
gadget has made you more capable of taking action (whatever action you pursue),
so you have embraced it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id163" id="gentleman-criminal" name="gentleman-criminal">2.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman Criminal</a></h3>
<p>Crime is usually a brutish thing, fueled by necessity, but for some it is the
only true challenge available. Usually possessed of copious talents, enough
that they have already found success elsewhere, gentleman criminals pursue a
life of crime because of its excitement. Such characters enjoy the good life
and civilization, so the adventures of exploration hold no appeal to them,
especially when compared to the thrill of the chase, outwitting investigators, and similar brushes with danger.</p>
<p>Often, these criminals turn into sociopathic masterminds as they turn more and
more to crime. But others maintain a certain basic, albeit twisted, honesty
that informs their crimes. A burglar may have a strong code to harm no one, or
may rob from the rich to give to the poor. An assassin may only accept
contracts on those he feels society is better off without. Most such ethical
criminals can be convinced to leave their past behind them and use their
talents to more challenging, world-bettering ends, but true retirement is not
often in their nature.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re trying to find something worth doing. When you find it, you seize upon it with gusto.</p>

<p>When we speak of the jungle lord, we’re speaking of characters like Tarzan or
Mowgli, a man raised by animals, possessed of great strength and ability to
communicate with or command animals.</p>
<p>Usually awkward in the face of civilization, these heroes act with a simpler
understanding of things like justice, but with time, they can become bridges
between two worlds.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re protecting your home and your pack, and attempting to understand the world outside.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id165" id="man-of-mystery" name="man-of-mystery">2.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man of Mystery</a></h3>
<p>There is no magic, only things science does not yet understand – and there are
a lot of those. The man of mystery has delved into these secrets, be they the
true workings of the mind, the “kung fu” of the eastern warriors, or perhaps a handful of syllables of the true name of God.</p>
<p>Whatever this knowledge is, it separates him from his fellow man, often so much
that the hero adopts a persona to allow separation between his heroic
personality and his normal life.</p>
<p>There’s a proximity to madness which mystery invites that can mean these heroes
are of a darker, more disturbing character than the norm.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’ve seen the darkness, and you’re on a mission to strike it down. You’re punishing those who think they’re above punishment.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id166" id="operator" name="operator">2.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operator</a></h3>
<p>The Operator is an agent, perhaps for a government agency that can’t be
acknowledged, perhaps for a secret organization. He may not know, himself.
But it means he’s connected (well connected), and is privy to secrets that
others just don’t know about.</p>
<p>His job? Whatever the agency says it is. Thankfully, that is usually exactly
what the Operator would be interested in doing in the first place. When
conflict eventually arises between the operator and the agency, it usually goes
very badly indeed for one of them or the other.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re serving a greater cause – perhaps for your
government, or perhaps a higher or more secret authority than that.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes the world so much smaller is the news. A few
decades back, if something happened a few states away, or anywhere else in the
world, it would take time to trickle into the awareness of the average person.</p>
<p>Now, with the telegraph and radio, people know what’s going on almost as soon
as it’s happened. The demand for regular news is fierce and competitive, and
in this day and age, “The Scoop” means a substantial advantage for newspapers –
if you’ve got the story, there’s no alternative, so people buy papers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, newspapers are always looking for news of the exotic and
interesting, and they’re willing to tolerate a lot of foibles from a reporter
who can bring in the big story.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You are finding out everything you can so you can
share it with the world.</p>

<p>Usually of a people that some explorer has ‘discovered’, the primitive is an outsider in the world that other heroes operate in. The subject of condescension and curiosity, he is also the keeper of knowledge that has been lost, or not yet discovered, by the white man in his tall cities.</p>
<p>Perhaps this knowledge is some form of “magic” or something more recognizable
as science, like a knowledge of botany far beyond what “modern” man has
discovered. One way or another, the primitive is usually quite sophisticated,
albeit in a way that most people don’t recognize.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You are representing your people, looking for knowledge to take back to them, or perhaps trying to carve out a new life in exile.</p>

<p>The science hero is the best way to summarize a character like Lester Dent’s
classic pulp hero Doc Savage: brilliant, tough, strong, basically better than you at everything, and made that way by science!</p>
<p>Thankfully, most science heroes are slightly less obvious examples of the superman incarnate. A science hero may be very much like a gadget hero, someone
who has benefited from extreme science in some way – perhaps making them a
little stronger, tougher or faster than they would have been.  Such characters
tend to be well rounded (though rarely to the somewhat silly level of a Doc
Savage himself ) but their specific interests are frequently tied to their
origin.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You do a bit of everything, taking all comers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id170" id="scientist" name="scientist">2.2.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientist</a></h3>
<p>In pulp, everyone is a scientist. Science is the door to the future, and every educated man has an interest in it. Despite that, it is easy to spot the committed scientist, master of one or more fields, dedicating his time and effort to the pursuit of science. Whereas other heroes seek adventure and appreciate science, the scientist seeks science and appreciates adventure.</p>
<p>While the scientist may have richly appointed labs or shops, there is still too
much to be found, too many theories to be tested, too much to do, to simply
stay cooped up. Scientists can have one or more fields of interest, which will
generally be reflected by their equipment. A chemist or botanist may have a
steady supply of bizarre and unique concoctions, while an engineer might have
exotic gadgets or weapons.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re challenging assumptions and testing theories,
bringing science out into the field with the intention of proving a theory that
can solve a problem or create something new and beneficial to mankind.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id171" id="two-fisted-pilot" name="two-fisted-pilot">2.2.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-Fisted Pilot</a></h3>
<p>The world is getting smaller as we watch, and aviation lies at the heart of it.
Every year, the utility of planes is growing, and their range and power
increases in kind. The pilot shares much of his spirit with the explorer, and
in many ways is the next step in the chain of discovery. The explorer may find
an exotic locale, but it is the pilot who ties it in to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The Great War made pilots into dashing, romantic figures, and the commercial
realities of the post-war era are making them more and more important.</p>
<p><em>What are</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>doing:</em> You’re connecting the world to itself. Your passion is in seeing all there is to see, going to strange and exotic locales and bringing the outside world along for the ride, and taking a piece with you when you leave.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id172" id="creating-the-character" name="creating-the-character">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating the Character</a></h2>
<p>Character generation takes place over five <em>phases</em>. Each phase outlines events
in that character’s life. The first phase sets up their general background,
concept, and early youth. The second covers the events of The Great War (the
common term of the time for World War I), bringing them to adulthood. The new
characters become adults in the final year of the War, and the last three
phases delve into the character’s post-War adventures.</p>
<p>As laid out, character creation is a group activity, done at the same time,
with at least three players (remember, the more players for a <em>character
creation session</em>, the better!) in addition to the GM. The character creation
process includes a number of built-in ways to establish ties and history
between the characters and the setting. Character creation can often take the
time of a full session of regular play, and is a good opportunity to lay out
the foundations of the setting, and allow everyone to establish a common
understanding of each others’ characters. During character creation, players
are encouraged to talk out loud about their characters, make suggestions to
each other, discuss how to make their characters intersect, talk about
relationships and interactions between the characters, and otherwise establish
some of the campaign background.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id173" id="preparation" name="preparation">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation</a></h2>
<p>Before the first phase, it’s a good idea to think about the concept for your
character. Your character could be modeled after a particular pulp hero, or
could be based around some specific thing that you want to be able to do, like
fly with a jetpack, blow things up, or break boards with your head.  Pulp
heroes can usually be described briefly, so try to think of a concept that you
can express simply. If you can express it with an exclamation point at the end,
all the better!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id174" id="names" name="names">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Names</a></h2>
<p>Pulp names can be like any kind of name, but there is usually a particular
cadence to them. The most common model is a short first name and a last name
which is also a word (usually a noun or adjective, but sometimes a proper noun
will be a good fit). This allows for simple, resonant names like “Drake Devlin”,
“Maggie Honor”, “Jack Stone”, and so on.</p>
<p>More “normal” names are fine too, but in the world of Pulp, they suggest a bit
of removal from the action. Such names are more appropriate if your character
also has an alias (a la Lamont Cranston and The Shadow) or is intentionally
cultivating an aristocratic air.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>

<p>This phase covers the character’s youth, from birth to age 14, but in a more
abstract sense also covers the core concept for the character as a “normal
person”. While youth may be a time of adventure and excitement, it is also the
time when we are most shaped by our family and environs. This phase is an
opportunity to reflect the character’s family and upbringing.  When describing
events in this phase, consider answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What were the family’s circumstances like? Rich? Poor? Scholarly?
Isolated? Pious? Political?</li>
<li>How big is the family?</li>
<li>How well does the character get along with his family?</li>
<li>What nation is the character from? What region?</li>
<li>How was the character educated?</li>
<li>What were the character’s friends like? Did the character get into

<p>Phase two is World War I, or as it’s called in the 1920s, The Great War.  While
the characters may technically have been too young to serve, they may have done
so anyway; as exceptional individuals, it would not have been hard for them to
fake their age. Because we’re talking about pulp heroes here, while they may
have spent some time in the trenches, it’s more likely that they spent most of
their time on top secret missions for elite soldiers, spies, researchers or
pilots. Alternatively, they may have spent their time in other parts of the
world, dealing with the end of colonialism, or exploring the mysterious East.</p>
<p>This is the time when the characters start coming into their own, and begin
realizing their true potential.</p>
<p>Some questions to consider during this period:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Did your character fight in the war? For whom? Where? In what
capacity?</li>
<li>Were you a member of any secret units? Did you meet any of the
other characters there?</li>

<p>Phase three is the character’s first pulp novel, starring him or her! Each
player needs to come up with a title for the novel starring his character, in a
fashion reminiscent of the pulps. The general pattern is:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Character Name</strong> (vs./in.../and) <em>Adventurous Thing!</em></blockquote>
<p>As such, <strong>Diego MacKinnon</strong> and <em>the Spider's Web</em> or <strong>Drake Devlin</strong> in... <em>The Redemption Game</em> would be ideal.</p>
<p>Then, each player needs to think up a story to go with his title. The story
doesn’t need to have a lot of detail – in fact, it should be no more detailed

<p>At the beginning of this phase, the GM writes down all the book titles on
separate sheets of paper or a set of index cards, shuffles the stack, and hands
them out. If a player gets his own novel, he should trade index cards with the
person to his right until everyone has a title that isn’t theirs. The title of
the book a player is now holding is a book that his character had a supporting
role in. For each index card, the involved players – the player whose book it
is, and the player who has just received that book’s index card – should
discuss the story, and add one or two sentences to the description of the novel
to reflect the supporting character’s role.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id190" id="motivation" name="motivation">2.15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation</a></h3>
<p>We keep coming back to this, but it’s critical to determine why your character
does what he does. SotC characters are exceptional, and they could very easily
find success in less exciting fields than those that are likely to come the way
of the characters, so it is on your head to figure out <em>why</em> your character is
going to keep getting involved in these things.  If you don’t, the GM is under
no obligation to go out of her way to make the game work for you – she’ll be
too busy with other players who made characters that have a reason to
participate.</p>
<p>This may sound a little harsh, but there’s a habit that a lot of smart,
talented players develop over time that leads them to want to “win” the game.
By having a character leave the adventuring life and become wealthy, powerful
and successful elsewhere, they beat the system that otherwise forces them to
constantly grind against an escalating scale of opposition for negligible
rewards.</p>
<p>The thing to remember with SotC is that your character has already won. He’s
successful enough that he doesn’t need to do anything adventurous with his
life, so it’s up to you to figure out why he does so.</p>
<p>One way or another, the answer almost always points to the idea that success
is not a goal, it’s a means. The true goal, whatever it is for the character,
is something that calls for action. Once you have that pinned down, you almost
definitely want to reflect it in your choice of aspects.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id191" id="choosing-aspects" name="choosing-aspects">2.15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing Aspects</a></h3>
<p>Aspects can be both useful and dangerous, but they should never be boring.
Whenever you choose an aspect, stop a minute to think about what kinds of
situations you can imagine using it for, and what kind of trouble it might get
you into. The very best aspects suggest answers to both those questions, and an
aspect that can answer neither is likely to be very dull indeed.</p>
<p>When you’re picking aspects, one of the best ways to determine that you and the
GM are on the same page is to discuss three situations where you feel the
aspect would be a help or a hindrance.</p>
<p>This is especially handy if the GM suggests the aspect – she probably has a
pretty clear idea of what it means when she suggests it, but that idea may not
be immediately obvious.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id192" id="powerful-aspects" name="powerful-aspects">Powerful Aspects</a></h4>
<p>At first glance, the most powerful aspects would seem to be things that are
broadly useful with no real downside, things like “Quick”, “Lucky” or “Strong”,
and a lot of players are tempted to go with those out the gate.  <strong>Resist that
temptation!</strong></p>
<p>See, there are three very large problems with aspects like this: they’re
boring, they don’t generate fate points, and they surrender your ability to
help shape the story.</p>
<p>Boring is a pretty obvious problem. Consider a character who is “Lucky” and one
who has “Strange Luck”. The latter aspect can be used for just as many good
things as the former, but it also allows for a much wider range of
possibilities.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to have some room for negative results of aspects. This may
seem counterintuitive at first, but remember that every time an aspect makes
trouble for you, you’ll receive a fate point, which is a pretty powerful
incentive.</p>
<p>To come back to “Strange Luck”, it means that the GM can throw bizarre, even
unfortunate, coincidences at the character, but <strong>you get paid for it.</strong> If
this doesn’t seem tempting enough yet, remember that the GM is probably going
to do something bizarre to you anyway – shouldn’t you benefit from it, and have
some say in how it happens?</p>
<p>And that leads to the last point. When the GM sits down to plan an adventure,
she’s going to look over the aspects of the players involved. If one character
has the aspect “Quick” and another has the aspect “Sworn Enemy of the Secret
Brotherhood of the Flame”, which one do you think suggests more ideas for the
GM?</p>
<p>Your aspects give you a vote in what sort of game you’re going to be playing
in, so don’t let it go to waste. If nothing else, you have just established
that the Secret Brotherhood of the Flame exists in the setting, and the GM will
probably turn to you for the details.</p>
<p>So in the end, the most powerful aspects are easy to spot, because they’re the
most <em>interesting</em> ones. If you consider that you want an aspect you can use to
your advantage but which can also be used to generate fate points, then it’s
clear you will get the most mechanical potency out of an aspect that can do
both. What’s more, aspects that tie into the world somehow (such as to a group,
or a person) help you fill in the cast and characters of the world in a way
that is most appealing to you.</p>
<p>Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, <strong>maximize
their interest.</strong> For more extensive advice on choosing aspects, see the
Aspects chapter, starting at page XX.</p>

<p>Sometimes you simply do not have time to do a full character generation and you
just want to get started. In those situations, simply begin with a blank
character sheet, and ask each player to choose the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>A name and brief description of their character</dt>
<dd>by brief we mean a sentence or two will suffice. The character may have a
more detailed background, but this is not the time to go into it.</dd>
<dt>The character’s apex skill</dt>
<dd>Whatever skill the character has at Superb should be selected and written
down on the sheet – or, if you want a little more than that, the character’s
“top three” skills.</dd>
<dt>Two aspects</dt>
<dd>one should be something primarily positive about the character, while the
other should be a weakness or flaw. This is not mandatory – they really can
be any two aspects, but players will have an easier time if they have a
little bit of a mix. For each aspect determined in advance, the character
earns a fate point, so characters made with this method start with two fate
points.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That’s it. Players are free to fill in more details as they see fit, but that’s
all you need to do to start playing. If you’re looking to make your game as
much of a pickup game as it can be, this may be exactly what you need.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id194" id="creation-on-the-fly" name="creation-on-the-fly">2.16.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation on the Fly</a></h3>
<p>Once play begins, whenever the GM calls for a roll on a skill, each player has
three options.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If they have the skill on their sheet, roll it normally.</li>
<li>If they don’t have it on their sheet, they can write it down in any
empty slot and roll it at the chosen level.</li>
<li>They can roll it at Mediocre.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, the player ends up filling out the skill tree over the course of
play.  Similarly, the player may write in aspects and stunts at the point where
they would use them.</p>
<p>Every time you write down an aspect, take a fate point. This way, when you’ve
filled in your 10th aspect, you’ll have earned a total of ten fate points, just
like other starting characters.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Players are still expected to come up with their character’s novel and guest
appearances in other novels, but this is also done on the fly. Players should
feel free to think about their title of their novel over play, and at any point
when they need a fate point they can launch into a flashback, generally
prefaced by a statement line “This reminds me of * &lt;Title of their Novel&gt; * ”.
The players give a quick blurb of a salient point from their novel and how this
reminds them of it, however tenuously. As soon as this is done, the player
gains a fate point. If the player then immediately spends the FP to make a
declaration about the scene, the GM may give it extra weight for falling in
line with the flashback.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id195" id="some-tips" name="some-tips">Some Tips</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure players get values set for Athletics, Endurance, Resolve,
and Alertness early on. Those skills are important enough to things
like combat that players will end up feeling frustrated if they
don’t think to pick those up until it’s too late. A fighting skill
like Guns, Weapons, or Fists may be important, too.</li>
<li>Stunts are a lot harder to choose on the fly than skills are, so the
GM needs to keep the character concepts in mind, and suggest stunts
when the situation seems to dictate that it might be useful.  Look
at skills rated close to the top of the character’s pyramid, then
look to the stunts chapter (page XX) and locate the skill in
question. Each skill has a few sets under it that are conceptually
linked and can help quick picking. But for even faster picking,
refer to our Quick Stunt Picks appendix, page XX.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about apparent contradictions, such as situations where
a player picks a skill at a high level after rolling it at Mediocre
several times, or chooses a stunt which would have made an earlier
scene play out differently. There is no contradiction. The character
was playing their cards close to the vest, and like in much
adventure fiction, their abilities only matter from the point where
they’re revealed.</li>

When he heard that the older boys were enlisting in the army to fight the Germans, Lexington knew what he must do. His father had taught him to see bureaucracies and societies and organizations as great machines. The right adjustment could improve their function or send them crashing down. A more subtle adjustment, and they do your bidding without even realizing. In the Autumn of 1916, he boarded the ship with a new identity to fight in the trenches in Flanders. His ability to blend in with just about everyone from any upbringing made him an ideal candidate for espionnage. He learned the tricks of the trade from Captain Jake Forsythe, who acted the kind father that Lexington (now Diego) always dreamed of. He was as supportive as he was firm, and always covered for Diego. Alas, on a mission in Budapest in 1917, the two were separated and Diego was forced to return alone. When he reached Paris, Diego vowed to find Captain Forsythe before he died.</td>

<p>Characters have a set of attributes called <strong>aspects</strong>. Aspects cover a wide
range of elements and should collectively paint a decent picture of <em>who</em> the
character is, what he’s <em>connected</em> to, and what’s <em>important</em> to him. (By
contrast, skills could be said to paint a similar picture of what the character
can <em>do</em>.) Aspects can be relationships, beliefs, catchphrases, descriptors,
items or pretty much anything else that paints a picture of the character.</p>
<p>Scenes also have aspects. Aspects in this context serve as a compact way to
describe the relevant details of an environment, and can be used by the
characters present in the scene. See Encountering Other Aspects, page XX, for
more.</p>
<p>In terms of game rules, aspects are the main avenue by which a player gains or
spends <strong>fate points</strong>, a kind of currency that can be spent for bonuses or
earned when aspects cause problems for the player.  Some possible aspects for
characters include:</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id197" id="picking-character-aspects" name="picking-character-aspects">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking Character Aspects</a></h2>
<p>More than anything else, aspects are a player’s most explicit way of telling the GM, “This is the stuff I want to see in the game”. If the player picks an aspect like “Death Defying”, then he should be able to fully expect that the GM will put him in death-defying situations. GMs should want players to use their aspects; players should pick the ones they want to use, and GMs should encourage them to choose aspects that will be both interesting and useful.</p>
<p>Once a player decides on an idea for an aspect, he needs to figure out what aspect name best describes what he intends; there are usually many possible names for a desired aspect, which can make this choice somewhat difficult.  However, most of the time, an aspect is going to be a <strong>phrase</strong>, a <strong>person</strong> or a <strong>prop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>phrase</strong> can be anything from a descriptive phrase (“Strong As An Ox”) to a simple descriptor (“Strong”), or even a literal quote (“No One Is Stronger Than Sledge!”). Phrase aspects come into play based on how well the situation matches them; a colorful phrase adds a lot of flavor and innately suggests several different ways to use it. This potentially makes phrase aspects some of the most flexible aspects in the game.</p>
<p>A <strong>person</strong> can be anyone important to the character. A friend, an enemy, a family member, a sidekick, a mentor – as long as someone matters to the character, he makes an appropriate aspect. A person aspect is most easily used when that person is in the scene with the character, but the aspect can come up in other ways, depending upon the person’s history and relationship with the character. For example, if a character has his mentor as an aspect, that aspect might be useful for things his mentor would have instructed him on.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> are things, places or even ideas – anything external to the character that isn’t a person. A prop can be useful if it’s something the character has with him, or if it’s the crux of a conflict, but it may also imply things about the character, or even be useful in its absence (if only I had my “Trusty Toolbox”!).</p>
<p>These three categories of aspects aren’t hard and fast. An aspect like “Maggie needs us <em>now</em>!" has elements of both a phrase and a person, and that’s just fine.  We’ve just provided these categories to help provide a way to think about how to frame aspects.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id198" id="why-would-i-want-a-bad-aspect" name="why-would-i-want-a-bad-aspect">3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Would I Want a Bad Aspect?</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that a number of the aspects throughout this book are “bad” aspects – they indicate a downside for a character, either in their directly negative connotations, or in their two-edged nature. Aspects like Drunkard, Sucker, Stubborn, and Honest all suggest situations where the character will have to behave a certain way – making an ass of himself at an important social function, falling for a line of bull, failing to back down when it’s important to do so, or speaking truth when truth is the path to greatest harm.</p>
<p>So why put such aspects on your sheet if they’re only going to make trouble for you? Simple: you want that kind of trouble.</p>
<p>On a basic, game-rules footing, “bad” aspects are a direct line to getting you more fate points – and fate points are the electricity that powers some of the more potent <em>positive</em> uses of your aspects. We’ll get more into how aspects can generate and use fate points later on in this chapter.</p>
<p>Outside of just the rules, a “bad” aspect adds interest and story to a character in a way that purely positive aspects cannot. This sort of interest means time in the limelight. If someone’s trying to take advantage of the fact your character’s a Sucker, that’s an important point in the story, and the camera’s going to focus on it. “Bad” aspects also immediately suggest story to your GM; they tell her how to hook your character in. From the perspective of playing the game to get involved and have fun, there’s nothing but good in this sort of “bad”.</p>
<p>Clever players will also find positive ways to use “bad” aspects. The Drunkard might get looked over more easily by prying eyes as “just a drunk”; someone who’s Stubborn will be more determined to achieve his goals. This brings us the “secret” truth about aspects: the ones that are most useful are the ones that are the most <em>interesting</em>. And <em>interesting</em> comes most strongly from aspects that are <em>neither</em> purely good nor purely bad.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, when picking an aspect, think of three situations where you can see the aspect coming into play. If you’ve got one reasonably positive situation and one reasonably negative situation out of that set, you’re golden!  If they’re all of one type, you may want to reconsider how you’ve worded your aspect – try to put a little of what’s missing in there.  Ultimately, though, one aspect that’s “all good” or “all bad” isn’t that much of a problem, so long as you have a good mix throughout your whole set.</p>

<p>Aspects are one of the major sources of flavor for your character; they’re the first thing a GM will look at on your sheet when trying to work out what sort of stories to throw you into. This is powerful juju, and the best part is, you are in <em>total</em> control of it with the words you choose for your aspect.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re writing down the name of an aspect, ask yourself, “how much flavor does this aspect suggest?” If it seems fairly colorless, then you might well be off the mark, and it’s time to kick it up a notch. Certainly, don’t feel like you have to do this with every aspect you take, but if your character is served up as a bland dish, you may discover that your GM is at loose ends for keeping him involved in the story.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, the “bland” option certainly suggests its uses, but doesn’t really jump off the page as something that suggests story. The “tasty” option is certainly better by dint of being more specific; both GM and player can see some potential story hooks in these, and they serve to differentiate themselves interestingly from their blander predecessors. But the “bam!” options are where it’s at.</p>
<p>“Man of Iron” could easily be the phrase others use to identify the character, and suggests more applications than simple strength. “Eye of Anubis” names the cult the character was once a part of, sends the GM looking to ancient Egypt for some story ideas, and starts to put some NPCs onto the map.  “Trained by Montcharles” gives the player plenty of opportunity for flashbacks to his time with Pierre Montcharles, which may include lessons and history that don’t <em>just</em> have to do with fencing, and also hints at the possibility of Pierre himself showing up in a story down the line. So when you pick an aspect, ask yourself: is this bland, is this tasty, or is this “bam!”?</p>

<p>Here’s a point to follow on the previous ones: more often than not, aspects tend to divide into another set of two camps – <strong>story</strong> and <strong>situation</strong> – and it’s a good idea to make sure you have aspects of each type.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong> aspects suggest one or more sources for stories involving the character, by bringing in an external element from the world at large. People and prop aspects are almost exclusively story aspects. Phrase aspects <em>might</em> be story aspects, but if they are, it’s usually because they mix in some elements of the other two Ps. You can most easily identify a story aspect by asking yourself if the aspect, independent of the character, is something other characters might interact with, affect, and change. Strange cults, lost artifacts, enemies, hidden lairs, foreign lands, spouses, and more, all fit into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong> aspects suggest the <em>kind</em> of situations a character might be in much more than they suggest the <em>origin</em> of those situations. Phrase aspects fall strongly into this camp, and they operate as a statement to the GM of the style of stories the player wants his character to be in. Phrase aspects like “Nick of Time”, “Stubborn as a Mule”, and “Last Man Standing” all suggest vivid situations – ones which should rightly repeat themselves over the course of playing the character – but don’t really suggest the <em>context</em> of those situations.</p>
<p>We’re taking a few moments to focus on the split between story and situation aspects, because it’s an easy one to miss if you’re not looking for it.  You can very easily fall into the trap of creating a character who only has situation aspects. On the surface, situation aspects may be more attractive, since they usually apply in a multitude of circumstances; certainly, you’ll want to have at least a few situation aspects in your repertoire.</p>
<p>But if situation aspects are <em>all</em> that your character offers to the game, you run a real risk of being difficult to hook into the bigger storyline. This is why you should be certain to include a few story aspects on your character.  Fundamentally, story aspects offer easy hooks to your GM to pull you into her story. You want this, since you came to the party to play the game. But it’s more than just that. By providing story aspects, you’ve provided some things which exist separately from your character. At the core of it, this means you’ve helped to build the game world. You’ve got ownership and stakes in the bigger picture. The GM will be grateful to you for it, and that kind of gratitude pays out in the form of a more satisfying game.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that, so far, we’re using a lot of ink to talk about how
your aspects communicate things about your character to the GM. We mean it. Out
of all the things in the game, aspects are probably the clearest message you
can send to the GM about what you want from the game, short of walking right up
to the GM and saying so. Also, in all likelihood, the GM is going to have
copies of your character sheets when you’re not around, so the aspects you’ve
picked are going to represent you in absentia.  Once you’ve picked all the
aspects for your character, take a step back and look at them as a whole, and
ask yourself if they make the kind of representation you’d want them to. If
they don’t, change them!</p>
<p>By themselves, aspects can’t say it <em>all</em>, of course, and it’s important to
remember that. Short of making each aspect a paragraph or essay, you’re dealing
with a few short, catchy phrases and names here. You want them reasonably
short, because you want to be able to talk about them casually without running
out of breath.</p>
<p>But the brevity of an aspect’s name means some things are left unspoken.  Take
the time with the GM to speak these unspoken things when you can.  Both the
player and the GM should look at an aspect not as the end of an idea, but the
start of one. You’re both going to bring your own ideas of what the aspect
means to the table and, at least to some extent, you’re both right. Usually
this works out fine – the combined perspectives make the whole greater than the
sum – but sometimes the GM and the player will have a radically different idea
of what the aspect entails. Be clear with one another, and figure out how to
iron out any differences – ideally, <em>before</em> the fate points start flying.</p>
<p>That said, after you’ve gotten one or more sessions of play under your belt,
you might feel like you’ve picked one or more aspects that don’t “feel right”.
We’re sympathetic to that, and your GM should be, too. If an aspect doesn’t
seem to be working out well for you, you should feel free to ask your GM if you
can change it.</p>

<p>The process of using an aspect begins by declaring that one is relevant.
Either the player or the GM may make this declaration. Then, determine if the
aspect’s relevance is working for or against the character who has the aspect.
As a <em>general</em> rule of thumb, if it’s <em>for</em>, the owner spends a fate point.  If
it’s <em>against</em>, the owner gains a fate point unless he pays to avoid it.</p>
<p>This is the guiding principle that all specific uses of aspects – invoking,
tagging, compelling – start from. Each type of aspect use has specific rules
governing how it functions, but if you ever find yourself confused about from
there.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id203" id="invoking-aspects" name="invoking-aspects">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoking Aspects</a></h2>
<p>An aspect can be used to give you a bonus, when that aspect applies to the
situation you are in. Doing this requires <strong>spending a fate point</strong> (see
below), and is called <strong>invoking the aspect</strong>. In this context, the aspect
makes the character better at whatever it is he’s doing, because the aspect in
some way applies to the situation. Invoking an aspect can be used to either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pick up all the dice you rolled and re-roll them, or</li>
<li>Leave the dice alone and add 2 to the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to use more than one aspect on a single roll, but you cannot use
the <em>same</em> aspect more than once on the same roll or action; even if you’ve
re-rolled the dice, that’s still the “same roll”. Re-rolls are riskier than
just taking the +2 bonus – you can always end up worsening things or not making
much improvement – but when a lot of ⊟ dice hit the table, a reroll can be a
much cheaper way to recover.</p>
<p>The GM is the final arbiter of when an aspect is or is not appropriate (see
“Getting On the Same Page”, page XX). Usually this means the player must invoke
an aspect that is appropriate to the situation at hand. If the player wants to
invoke an inappropriate-seeming aspect, he should be given a chance to describe
how the action is appropriate to the aspect. The GM’s priority here is not to
strictly limit the use of aspects but rather, to encourage their appropriate
use by encouraging players to make decisions that keep their aspects
interesting.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id204" id="invoking-for-effect" name="invoking-for-effect">3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoking for Effect</a></h3>
<p>A player can also <strong>invoke an aspect for effect</strong>, using it for a related
benefit that is not related to a die roll or skill use at all. This costs a
fate point like any other invocation does. For example, a player could invoke a
Secret Organization aspect to declare that the group has a chapter in town.</p>
<p>This is subject to the same sort of restrictions as spending fate points for
minor declarations (see page XX) but is more potent due to the focus of the
aspect. To be explicit, when an aspect is part of a declaration, it can make
the less plausible more plausible, thus allowing the player to “get away with”
more. The scope of the minor declaration can be … well, less minor, and the GM
is encouraged to keep this in mind.</p>
<p>For example, if the GM is inclined to hem and haw over whether or not the
character can spend a fate point to declare that he arrives at the exactly
right moment, invoking the character’s Perfect Timing or Grand Entrance aspect
for that same effect should remove any of the GM’s doubts. That said, this is
not a method for the players to get away with anything; as always, aspect
invocation is only allowed when the GM approves.</p>

<p>The aspects on your character are not the only aspects that you can potentially
use. Your fellow players’s characters have aspects, of course, as do some
NPCs; sometimes even the <strong>scene itself</strong> may have aspects, like Dark or
Cluttered.</p>
<p>To invoke an aspect other than your own, your character needs to directly
interact with the object, location, or person that has the aspect you want to
invoke, in a way appropriate to the action in progress. This means that if a
scene has an aspect of Rigging (since it’s on a pirate ship), not only does
that mean characters can be described as swinging from the ropes, but
characters can invoke the Rigging aspect when they do so.  And that leads us
to…</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id206" id="tagging" name="tagging">Tagging</a></h4>
<p><strong>Tagging</strong> refers to the act of invoking an aspect that isn’t your own; this
includes scene aspects and aspects on other characters. In most respects this
functions the same way as with an aspect on your own character’s sheet – spend
the fate point, and get either a +2 bonus or a re-roll.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Taggable aspects are sometimes introduced into play as the result of your
character’s action. This can happen due to a maneuver in a conflict (see page
XX), a declaration of a previously nonexistent aspect (see page XX), or the
assessment of a target and revelation of one of the target’s previously hidden
aspects (see page XX).</p>
<p>Whenever an aspect is introduced into play like this, it’s because the character has made some sort of effort to bring it to the fore – he’s rolled well
on whatever skill check brought the aspect onto the map. Because this is the
case, he’s earned the right to tag the aspect in question once, without
spending a fate point. In this way he’s able to turn his previous success into
a momentary advantage without it hitting his fate point budget.</p>
<p>A free tag is subject to one key limitation: it must occur <strong>immediately</strong>
after the aspect’s been brought into play. Some minor delay isn’t encouraged,
but is acceptable. This usually means that the free tag must be taken within
the <strong>same</strong> scene that the aspect was introduced.</p>
<p>The player who introduced the aspect has the option to pass his free tag to
another character if he so wishes. This can allow for some great setup
maneuvers in a fight; one person maneuvers to place an aspect on a target, then
passes the free tag to an ally, who attacks, using the advantage. This can
only be done, however, if it is reasonable that the advantage could be “passed
off ”. A sniper who uses a maneuver to aim his rifle at a target, putting an
“In My Sights” aspect on it, can’t pass the advantage to someone else – the
aspect placed is specific to him. But if one pugilist used a maneuver to put an
“Off Balance” aspect on a foe, he could reasonably pass the advantage to his
buddy who moves in for the knockout blow.</p>
<p>When the character does spend a fate point to tag another character’s aspect,
it might mean that the character getting tagged is due a reward. If the
character tagging is getting a benefit out of it that is to the tagged
character’s <em>detriment</em>, then the fate point spent on the tag goes to the
tagged character at the end of the exchange (<em>i.e.</em>, he can’t use it until the
next one).</p>
<p>Tagging often involves temporary aspects that result from maneuvers.  Make sure
you have a grasp on how temporary aspects behave; see the “How to Do Things”
chapter, page XX, for more. Many temporary aspects are fragile, and may
disappear after their first tag (what does that mean exactly? – read that
chapter!).</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id207" id="to-catch-a-king-tagging-for-effect" name="to-catch-a-king-tagging-for-effect">To Catch a King (Tagging for Effect)</a></h5>
<p>It’s important to remember that the aspects which have been placed on a
character can be invoked for effect just as easily as they can be invoked for a
bonus. A classic example of this is from the play Hamlet, where Hamlet arranges
a very specific play to test the king’s guilt. There, the performance by the
actors was less about putting an aspect on the scene (see page XX), so much as
putting a specific aspect on the king himself (such as “A Revelation of
Murder”).</p>
<p>If a character is aware of such an aspect on another, he may tag for effect,
<strong>spending a fate point</strong> to trigger (potentially) the circumstances of a compel
(see “Compelling Aspects”, page XX) depending on what the player declares and
the GM accepts.</p>
<p>If it does turn out to be a compel-worthy circumstance, then the GM may proceed
with it. This is a chain reaction; the tag for effect occurs, and concludes
with the GM indicating whether or not it struck home.</p>
<p>If it struck home, then it’s now the GM’s job to run the compel with the target
– and since it’s a compel, it includes the option for the target to spend a
fate point instead of receiving one, to buy out of it. Note that because this
is a compel that is now in the GM’s hands, if the target buys out of the
compel, the fate point spent does not go to the tagger!</p>
<p>As far as the <em>tagger’s</em> involvement is concerned, however, this is often
happening as part of his “free tag” for placing or revealing the aspect on the
target – so his own fate point liability is trivial.</p>
<p>Sadly for Claudius (and ultimately Hamlet!), he accepted the fate point
(perhaps as a compel against his “Guilty Conscience”) and betrayed himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id208" id="guessing-aspects" name="guessing-aspects">Guessing Aspects</a></h5>
<p>Tags usually happen when the tagger has a clear idea of what aspect is there to
be tagged. But this is not always the case; sometimes, the player’s making a
<em>guess</em>. Guesses are allowed, but are subject to some special rules.</p>
<p>If the guess hits reasonably close to the mark conceptually, even if it doesn’t
exactly match the aspect’s name, the GM should exercise some flexibility and
allow it. For example, someone might guess that a scene has a Darkness aspect
on it and ask if they can tag it for their Stealth roll. Even though the scene
had the aspect “Shadowed Corners” instead, this is reasonably close to the
mark; the GM should reveal that the aspect is Shadowed Corners, and allow the
tag.</p>
<p>If the guess just plain misses the mark, and the fact that the mark was missed
doesn’t constitute a significant, potentially secret, piece of information,
the player should get the chance to reconsider and take back his fate point.
Using the same example, if the player was asking if the scene had a Darkness
aspect, and the GM instead believes the scene is too well lit for that, she
would simply tell the player it’s a no-go. While the fact that the scene is
well lit is certainly important, it’s something the player could discover
with a simple question and answer about the details of the scene, so it doesn’t
really rate as a secret; he shouldn’t be charged a fate point for that.</p>
<p>If the guess misses the mark, but missing the mark tells the player something
significant and potentially secret, the fate point is still spent. This sort of
circumstance almost never comes up with scene aspects, but can come up when
guessing at aspects on another character. For example, if a character is
looking to tag someone’s “Guilty Conscience” to help him intimidate that
target, and it turns out that the target doesn’t have that aspect for him to
tag, the fate point stays spent, because it is significant and secret that the
target does <em>not</em> have an aspect that’s even in the ballpark of “Guilty
Conscience”.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, a character’s guess misses the mark because he’s
been duped. This will most often happen as the result of a Deceit action (see
page XX), although it might arise from other circumstances. In such a case, the
deceiver has the option to return the fate point to the tagger, or to leave it
spent. If he leaves it spent, the tagger just learned he was duped.  The
deceiver does not get this spent fate point for himself – it’s simply gone. If
he returns it to the tagger, things may actually be a bit worse for the tagger:
the deceiver gets to place a temporary aspect on him (and the first tag’s for
free, as above), representing how the deceiver managed to snooker the target.</p>
<p>Regardless, guesses can’t, and shouldn’t, be made willy-nilly – there must
always be a justification for making the guess. If the guess seems unjustified – if the player is “shotgunning” guesses to randomly try to figure out
another character’s aspects – the GM is completely justified in shutting that
player down cold.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id209" id="compelling-aspects" name="compelling-aspects">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compelling Aspects</a></h2>
<p>An aspect can also allow a player to gain more fate points, by bringing
complications and troubling circumstances into his character’s life. When this
occurs, it’s referred to as <strong>compelling the aspect</strong>. The GM performs compels;
when she compels someone’s aspect, she’s indicating that the character is in a
position where the aspect could create a problem. However, players can cause
the GM to compel another character’s aspects, via tagging, with a similar
rationale and results (see “Tagging for Effect”, above). The target whose
aspect is compelled usually has the choice of <strong>spending a fate point</strong> and
ignoring the aspect, or taking the consequences and limitations on his choices
and <strong>receiving a fate point</strong>. When the target accepts the fate point, the
aspect is officially <strong>compelled</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways an aspect can complicate a character’s life.</p>
<p>An aspect may limit actions and choice. If a character is given a situation
where he would normally have a number of choices, and limiting those choices to
act in accordance with his aspect is going to make more trouble for the
character, that’s grounds to compel the aspect. It’s important to note that an
aspect may dictate the <em>type</em> of action, but it usually shouldn’t dictate the
<em>precise</em> action, which is always the player’s decision. In this way, the
compel highlights the difficulty of the choices at hand by placing limits on
those choices.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>An aspect may also <em>complicate</em> a situation, rather than directly limiting a
character’s choices. If everything would be going along normally, and the
aspect makes things more difficult or introduces an unexpected twist, that’s
also grounds for a compel. In come cases, complications may suggest that
certain consequences are mandated, such as failing at a particular action –
perhaps the character would succeed at a defense roll against a Deceit action,
but his Gullible aspect is compelled, forcing a failure if accepted.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Sometimes the aspect may add a complication “offscreen”, such as when the GM
decides to use a character’s personal nemesis as the villain for a session. In
such a case the GM should remember to give the character a fate point. This is
<em>technically</em> a compel – it does complicate things – but more practically it’s
more of a “thank you” to the player for giving the GM a hook to build the
adventure around, and is done without offering the player the option to buy out
of it.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id210" id="negotiating-a-compel" name="negotiating-a-compel">3.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiating a Compel</a></h3>
<p>In play, both the GM and players can initiate compels. When the GM initiates a
compel, the process is very simple. The GM remarks that the aspect might be
appropriate here, and offers the player a fate point and the player either
accepts it and takes appropriate action or accepts appropriate consequence, or
he pays one of his fate points to the GM and chooses not to accept the
consequences of the compel.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, the GM is always aware of all aspects and always knows when
they should be compelled and rewarded. In practice, the GM is keeping track of
a <em>lot</em> of stuff, and may not realize that a player has an aspect that is
appropriate to the situation. When that happens, the player should feel free to
capture the GM’s attention and point to the appropriate aspect, and hold up a
fate point, indicating that he thinks it’s time for a compel.</p>
<p>The GM will then do one of two things.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>She may hold up a fate point of her own, as if she were compelling
the aspect, offering the player a choice to pay or be paid.</li>
<li>She may defer, offering a brief explanation. The GM may defer
for any reason – but doing so too often is potential grounds for
gathering up a posse and driving the GM out of town covered in
tar and feathers.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a player calls attention to one of his character’s aspects, it may be as
formal as “I think my Greedy aspect applies here” or it may be more
conversational, like “Boy, this is tough. I mean, I am pretty * Greedy * ”
(brandishes a fate point). There’s no one way to do it, and groups are
encouraged to fall into whatever pattern is most comfortable for them.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id211" id="accidental-compels" name="accidental-compels">3.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Accidental” Compels</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes characters simply play to their aspects without thinking to compel
them. When that happens, the GM should make a note of it (sometimes with the
player reminding her) and, if possible, award the player with a fate point
retroactively. If it’s too late for that, the GM should make a note to give
that player one extra fate point next session.</p>
<p>It’s important that the GM keep in mind what sorts of things would normally
constitute a compel. Compels happen in order to make certain choices or
situations more difficult or more dramatic for the compelled character.
Certainly, staying in character and playing in a way that’s appropriate to a
character’s aspects should be praised; but it should be rewarded only when the
player’s aspect-consistent play has actively made his character’s choices
more difficult.</p>

<p>Occasionally a character’s aspects will be in head to head conflict with one
another. This should not be seen as a problem — rather, it’s an opportunity for
high drama! When two aspects are in conflict with one another, they are both
subject to a compel. If the player can’t see a way to act in accordance with
both aspects, he must buy off at least one of them. In a number of cases, this
can lead to a “zero sum”, where one compel is accepted, gaining a fate point,
and the other is refused, spending that fate point. If the player can see clear
to acting in accordance with both – fantastic! He’s just gotten himself two
fate points (and a world of trouble).</p>
<p>The GM needn’t always press the issue in this fashion. Nothing says she has to
compel both aspects. But occasionally it’s more interesting if she does.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id213" id="escalation" name="escalation">Escalation</a></h4>
<p>Rarely, in moments of high tension or drama, the GM can choose to <strong>escalate</strong>
a compel. This is an <em>optional rule</em>, and really should only be used when the
character getting compelled is having a <em>defining moment</em> in his or her story.</p>
<p>Escalation can occur only when a player has bought out of a compel. To
escalate, the GM slides forward a second fate point, and prompts the player
with something like, “Are you sure…?” If the player accepts, he’ll get two fate
points instead of one; if he refuses, it’s going to cost him two fate points
instead of one. In the rarest of cases, facing a second refusal, the GM may
escalate a final time, making the reward and cost to buy out three fate points.
If the player is willing to spend three to refuse this truly monstrous
compulsion, the book is closed.</p>
<p>If a player’s willing to step it up, he can prompt the GM to start an escalation as well. When sliding forward his first fate point to buy off a compel,
the player should say something like, “I won’t go along for one fate point…”
Most GMs will look at the situation at that point and decide whether or not
it’s a moment of high drama; if it isn’t, they’ll take the proffered point, but
if it is, the escalation’s on!</p>
<p>Whatever the case, escalation should be done sparingly; it’s best as a spice,
and can be overwhelming as a main dish.</p>

<p>The battles over the Dardanelles, the straits separating the Ottoman Empire
from Europe, were supposed to be easy, a swift strike at the soft underbelly of
Europe against the virtually helpless Turks.  The result was a long, brutal
battle causing hundreds of thousands of deaths from fighting and disease on
both sides, and striking a devastating blow to ANZAC, Great Britain’s
Australian and New Zealand Corps.</p>
<p><strong>A player might invoke this to</strong>: As with Veteran, but also to know a bit about
the Turks.</p>
<p><strong>The GM might compel this to</strong>: As with Veteran, but also for many other
consequences. For ANZAC members, this battle is the root of vast swaths of
anti-British sentiment and inspiration for independence.</p>

<p>Characters in your games are going to do a lot. For most things they do,
there’s no real need for rules. Characters can stand, walk, talk, go shopping
and otherwise do normal things without needing to roll dice. They can even take
actions that use their skill, like driving to work, without worrying about the
dice. The dice only come out when there is an interesting challenge with
meaningful consequences.</p>
<p>On the simplest level, when a character rolls the dice, if he matches or
exceeds the difficulty, he succeeds; if he doesn’t, he fails. When the issue is
simple, then this may be all that’s necessary, but sometimes you also need to
know how well a character did or did not do. Clearly, if a character rolls
three higher than the target, that’s better than rolling only one higher.</p>
<p>The result of the roll is called the <strong>effort</strong>. Each point that the effort
beats the difficulty by is one <strong>shift</strong>. If a roll is below the target
difficulty, it’s a failure and it generates no shifts – there are no “negative”
shifts (if you flip the perspective, the opposition could be said to generate
shifts – but this is rarely relevant). If a roll matches the target difficulty,
it is a success but generates no shifts. If it beats it by one, it generates
one shift; if it beats it by two it generates two shifts, and so on. The number
of shifts generated by a roll is used as a measure of many elements, and is
referred to as the <strong>effect</strong>.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id229" id="using-shifts" name="using-shifts">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Shifts</a></h2>
<p>Shifts may be spent to affect the outcome of a roll. Often, the GM will
implicitly spend shifts in accordance with the player’s description of his
character’s actions. Sometimes, players may explicitly spend shifts as well.
Basic uses for one shift include:</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="field-name">
<col class="field-body">
</colgroup><tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Reduce time required:</th><td class="field-body">Make the action take less time.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Increase subtlety:</th><td class="field-body">Make the job harder to detect by one.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Exactly how shifts can be applied depends on the skill, and is detailed in the
write-ups of the individual skills, beginning on page XX. Later in this
chapter, we’ll also talk about how to deal with an excess of shifts, using the
concepts of overflow and spin (page XX).</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id231" id="simple-actions" name="simple-actions">4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple Actions</a></h3>
<p>Simple actions are rolled against a difficulty set by the GM and are used
to simply see if a character can do something, and possibly how well he
can do it. The GM describes the situation and the player chooses a skill to
apply to it, and rolls against a difficulty determined by the GM (by default,
Average). Some sample simple actions include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Climbing a wall</li>
<li>Looking up an obscure fact</li>
<li>Searching a crime scene for fingerprints</li>
<li>Shooting a (non-character) target</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id232" id="contests" name="contests">4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contests</a></h3>
<p>Contests are very much like simple actions, except the action is in direct
opposition to someone else and easily resolved one way or another. Rather than
setting a difficulty, each party rolls the appropriate skill, and the outcome
is resolved as if the high roll had beaten a difficulty equal to the low roll.
A tie means both succeed, but whether that means the outcome is a tie or if it
calls for another roll depends on the situation. Some sample contests include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An arm wrestling match</li>
<li>A footrace</li>
<li>A shouting match</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id233" id="conflicts" name="conflicts">4.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts</a></h3>
<p>Conflicts are what happen when two or more characters are in opposition in a
fashion that cannot be quickly and cleanly resolved. A conflict is broken down
into a number of exchanges where each party makes an effort to try to achieve
their goal, taking turns to act. Opponents who stand in their way may be called
upon to roll a response. They will accumulate success in the form of stress on
opponents. Eventually, opponents will accumulate enough stress, or suffer
enough consequences, to be taken out; alternatively, opponents may preemptively
offer a concession.</p>
<p>Conflicts are the most involved actions, and an entire scene may revolve
around a conflict. Conflicts include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any kind of fight scene</li>
<li>A political debate</li>
<li>A long, tense staredown</li>
<li>Trying to talk your way past a bouncer as he tries to scare you off</li>
</ul>
<p>The complexity of conflicts is such that they merit an entire section detailing
how they are handled.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id235" id="framing-the-scene" name="framing-the-scene">4.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Framing the Scene</a></h3>
<p>Over the course of a conflict, the elements in play in the scene can play a
part in how the conflict unfolds. In framing the scene, the GM declares if
there are any aspects on the scene, and lays them out for the players. (The use
of scene aspects is detailed on page XX.)</p>
<p>If the scene is taking place over a broad area, the GM also describes the zones
the scene will be occurring in. Each zone is a loosely defined area where
characters may directly interact with anyone else within that zone (which is a
nice way to say talk to or punch them). Who is in what zone affects things like
whether or not characters can attack each other or if they’ll need to throw
things or use ranged weapons. At the outset, determining which zones characters
start in should be reasonably intuitive, but if there is a question, the GM can
rule on where the character starts.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>When looking for a quick rule of thumb, remember that people in the same zone
can “touch” each other, people one zone apart can throw things at each other,
and people two (and sometimes three) zones apart can shoot each other. Any one
given scene should not involve more than a handful of zones. Considering that
guns easily operate over three zones, sometimes a few more, a comfortable
number would be around three to five zones – but don’t feel like you’re forced
to cram in more zones than the area readily supports.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id236" id="establish-groups" name="establish-groups">4.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish Groups</a></h3>
<p>Opposing individuals may all be detailed characters like the player’s
characters, but often minions, mooks, or other faceless supporters will
supplement the opposing force. These supporters are collectively called
“minons” and are handled slightly differently than other characters (page XX).
Minions divide themselves into a number of groups equal to the number of
opposing characters. If a side is composed of a mix of characters and minions,
characters may “attach” themselves to a group of minions, directing it and
taking advantage of its assistance.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Dealing with large groups is a potentially complex exercise for the GM. We
have several recommendations and strategies for making this a lot easier,
later in this chapter (page XX).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id237" id="establish-initiative" name="establish-initiative">4.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish Initiative</a></h3>
<p>The order of characters’ actions is determined at the beginning of the conflict, with characters acting from highest to lowest Alertness skill (for physical conflicts) or Empathy (for social conflicts). This is referred to as the order of initiative (i.e., “who takes the initiative to go when”).</p>
<p>Ties in initiative are resolved in favor of characters with a higher Resolve.
Any remaining ties are in favor of the player closest to the GM’s right.</p>
<p>When a character is attached to a group of minions, use the character’s
initiative. Otherwise the group of minions has initiative as indicated by the
quality of the group (as determined in “Minions”, page XX).</p>
<p>Once that order is established, that is the order in which actions are taken
for the duration of the exchange. When the last person has gone, the exchange
ends, and a new exchange begins with the first character acting again, and
everyone else acting in the same order.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id238" id="an-alternative-to-skills" name="an-alternative-to-skills">An Alternative to Skills</a></h4>
<p>For some play-groups the idea of using particular skills to determine
initiative may seem “unbalancing”, or at least unpleasant, in that it tends to
force certain skills to prominence in many a skill pyramid. Also, some GMs
don’t like having to keep track of a detailed order of actions. If your group
doesn’t like skill-based initiative, use this alternative method instead:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At the beginning of each exchange, the option to go first moves
one player clockwise around the table.</li>
<li>Initiative for that exchange proceeds clockwise (and includes the GM).</li>
<li>Thus, the person who went first on the prior exchange goes last on the
next one, and the others get their turn one step sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple method makes sure that everyone gets a chance to go first over
the course of a game, and doesn’t require the players to make any sorts of
special initiative-based decisions in their skill selections.</p>
</div>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id239" id="id10" name="id10">4.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Action</a></h3>
<p>When a player takes action, he describes what his character is doing and, if
necessary, rolls an appropriate skill. Each action is resolved as either a
simple action (if there is no opposition), or as a contest, with the details
depending upon the specifics of the action.</p>
<p>Most actions in a fight will be either attacks or maneuvers.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id240" id="attacks" name="attacks">Attacks</a></h4>
<p>An attack is an attempt to force the attacker’s agenda on a target, by
attempting to injure them, by bullying them, or by some other means. An attack
is rolled as a contest, with the attacking character (the attacker) attempting
to beat the defending character (the defender) in a roll of skills.</p>
<p>Not all attacks are necessarily violent. An attempt to persuade or distract
someone is also a sort of attack. When determining whether or not the attack
rules apply, simply look for two characters in conflict, an agenda (or “want”)
pushed by the acting character, and the target or obstacle to that agenda, the
defending (or “responding”) character.  The skills used to attack and defend
depend on the nature of the attacker’s agenda. Here are some examples.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="33%">
<col width="28%">
<col width="39%">

</table>
<p>If the attacker wins the roll, his shifts may be spent to inflict stress on the
defender (see “Resolving Actions”, page XX). If the defender wins, the attack
fails; if the defender wins significantly, he may even earn spin (see “Spin”,
page XX), which he can use to his advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id241" id="maneuvers" name="maneuvers">Maneuvers</a></h4>
<p>A maneuver is an attempt to change the situation in some way, affecting the
environment or other people, but without damaging or forcing the target (if
force is used or damage is dealt, it would be an attack). When a character
tries to jump to grab a rope, throw dust in an enemy’s eyes, draw eyes upon
himself in a ballroom, or take a debate down a tangential path – that’s a
maneuver.</p>
<p>A maneuver is either a simple action or a contest, with the difficulty or
opposition determined by the nature of the maneuver. A maneuver that doesn’t
target an opponent is resolved as a simple action. Most simple maneuvers like
this result in a character rolling against a GM-set difficulty and doing
something with the resulting shifts. A maneuver can also target an opponent,
and, if successful, place a temporary aspect on him. Either kind can also be
used to place a temporary aspect upon a scene. See the “Resolving Maneuvers”
section later in this chapter (page XX) for details.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id243" id="free-actions" name="free-actions">Free Actions</a></h5>
<p>Some kinds of actions are “free” – they don’t count as the character’s action
during an exchange, regardless of whether or not a roll of the dice is
involved. Rolling for defense against an attack is a free action. So are minor
actions like casting a quick glance at a doorway, flipping a switch right next
to the character, or shouting a short warning.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of free actions a character may take during an
exchange; the GM simply has to agree that each action is free, and should feel
free to impose limits if it seems like someone is taking excessive advantage of
this rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id244" id="full-defense" name="full-defense">Full Defense</a></h5>
<p>A character can opt to do nothing but protect himself for an exchange. By
foregoing his normal action, he gains a +2 on all reactions and defenses for
that exchange. Characters who are defending may declare it at the beginning of
the exchange rather than waiting for their turn to come around.  Similarly, if
they have not acted in the exchange at the time when they are first attacked,
they may declare a full defense at that point, again foregoing their normal
action for the exchange.</p>

<p>A character can opt not to act when his turn comes around. When a character
takes a hold action, he has the option of taking his turn any time later in the
exchange. He must explicitly take his turn after someone else has finished
their turn and before the next person begins. He cannot wait until someone
declares what they’re trying to do, then interrupt them by taking his turn.</p>
</div>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id246" id="block-actions" name="block-actions">Block Actions</a></h5>
<p>When the character’s action is preventative – trying to keep something from
happening, rather than taking direct action to make something happen – he is
performing a block action. He declares what he’s trying to prevent and what
skill he’s using to do it. Players may declare a block against any sort of
action or actions and may theoretically use any skill, but unless the block is
simple and clear, the GM may assess penalties based upon how hard it would be,
or how much of a stretch it would be. Players should never be able to “cover
all bases” with a single block.</p>
<p>A blocking character can declare that he is protecting another character.
He makes this declaration on his turn, and rolls the skill he’s using to block;
the result is the block strength. When, later that exchange, any enemy tries
to attack the protected character, the protected character gets the benefit
of both the blocker’s defense as well as his own, whichever is better. The
attacker rolls his attack as normal. The defender rolls his defense as normal.
If that defense roll is higher than the block strength, he uses the defense
result; otherwise he uses the block strength. The attacker then generates
shifts as normal.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>For other types of blocks, the blocking character declares the block on his
turn, and rolls the skill he’s using to block, subject to any penalties imposed
by the GM. The result is the block strength. Later that exchange, every time
another character tries to perform the blocked action, he enters into a contest
with the blocker. The character trying to get past the block rolls the skill
he’s using for the action (not a skill specifically appropriate to the block),
and compares it to the block strength. If the attacker gets at least one shift,
he successfully overcomes the block.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Trying to get past a block always takes an action, though the GM may grant
similar latitude in deciding what skill is being used to get past it.  Even if
the action is normally “free”, getting past the block takes additional effort,
and thus the GM can declare that it takes up the player’s action for the
exchange.</p>
<p>A variety of skills may be appropriate to getting past a block. Getting past a
block may occasionally require rolling a skill modified by another, secondary
skill, as demonstrated in this next example.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id247" id="supplemental-actions" name="supplemental-actions">Supplemental Actions</a></h5>
<p>Sometimes a character needs to do something more complicated than just taking a
single, basic action. Sometimes the complication is simple, like drawing a
weapon and attacking; sometimes it’s more complex, like composing a sonnet
while fencing.</p>
<p>When the character performs a simple action while doing something else, like
drawing a weapon and attacking, or firing off a signal flare while intimidating
the snapping wolves at the edge of the firelight, it is a supplemental action,
and simply imposes a -1 on the character’s primary action roll (effectively
spending one shift of effect in advance). When in doubt about which is the
primary action and which is the supplemental one, the supplemental action is
the one which would normally require no die roll.</p>
<p>Sometimes the GM may decide a supplemental action is particularly complicated
or difficult, and may increase the penalty appropriately.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id248" id="movement" name="movement">Movement</a></h6>
<p>Movement is one of the most common supplemental actions. When it is reasonably
easy to move from one zone to the next, characters may move one zone as a
supplemental action (see “Framing the Scene”, above, for an explanation of
zones). If they wish to move further than that, they must perform a primary
(not supplemental) sprint action, which entails rolling Athletics and allowing
the character to move a number of zones equal to the shifts generated.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is more difficult to move from one zone to the next, such as when
there is some sort of barrier (like a fence or some debris) or there is some
other difficulty (like getting from a rooftop to the street below and vice
versa). This movement complication is called a border. The numeric value of
that border increases the penalty for a move action and subtracts shifts from a
sprint action.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id249" id="combining-skills" name="combining-skills">Combining Skills</a></h5>
<p>Sometimes the character needs to perform a task that really requires using two
or more skills at once. You never know when a character is going to need to
throw a knife (Weapons) while balancing on a spinning log (Athletics) or when
he’s going to need to explain germ theory (Science) to one of the Dead Gods
(Resolve).</p>
<p>In those situations, the GM calls for a roll based on the main skill being used
(the primary thrust of the action), but modified by a second skill. If the
second skill is of greater value than the first, it grants a +1 bonus to the
roll; if the second skill is of a lesser value, it applies a -1 penalty to the
roll.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>When the second skill can only help the first, which is to say it can only
provide a bonus, it complements the skill. A complementing skill never applies
a -1, even if it’s lower than the primary skill. This usually happens when the
character has the option of using the secondary skill, but doesn’t have to
bring it to bear.</p>
<p>If the secondary skill comes into play only to hold the primary skill back, it
restricts the skill, meaning it can only provide a penalty or nothing at all.
A restricting skill never applies a +1, even if it’s higher than the primary
skill. Often skills like Endurance or Resolve are restrictive skills – as you
get more tired, you won’t get better, but if you’re resolute, you may not get
worse.</p>
<p>In very rare circumstances, a primary skill may be affected by more than one
secondary skill – say, a situation where a character needs to climb a wall
(Athletics as primary), but is tired (Endurance restricts), but the wall’s part
of a building the character has been studying in order to burglarize (Burglary
complements). In such cases, no matter the number of skills in play, the most
the combination can produce is one +1 and one -1. This is actually very quick
to reason out. First, look at all of the skills that modify or complement; if
any of them are higher than the primary skill, a +1 is applied. Next, look at
all of the skills that modify or restrict; if any of them are lower than the
primary skill, a -1 is applied. This may mean that multiple skills all
affecting a roll will result in no modification at all – both a +1 and a -1!</p>
<p>It’s important to note that combining skills can never be done to perform two
full actions at once – if that’s the goal, it should take two exchanges.  When
skills are used in combination, one skill is almost always going to serve a
passive role, as the thing the character needs to be able to do in order to be
able to perform the other skill. If a character is trying to throw a knife
while balancing on a spinning log, Weapons is the main skill rolled, but
Athletics restricts the roll, because without it, the character falls off the
log, and his throw is moot. Similarly, if the character is gibbering before an
ancient horror, his knowledge is simply not going to help him.</p>
<p>The difference between an action that combines skills, and a supplemental
action, is not always obvious. In general, if both components of the action are
something you’d expect to roll for if they were done separately, then it’s time
to combine skills. If the lesser part of the action is something that normally
doesn’t require a roll, just handle it as a supplemental action.  Sometimes, an
action will be both supplemental and modified – maybe the character is moving a
little (supplemental), but is using his Athletics skill to get an edge
(modifying the primary roll):</p>

<p>When a character is in a position to control the pacing of a conflict (which
generally requires the conflict be one on one, or ritualized in some way), he
may stretch it out and try to wear down his opponent. When this happens,
actions in a conflict start using the character’s Endurance skill to restrict
(see page XX) the skill used on any of his actions. Similarly, actions may be
restricted by Alertness if the conflict starts having too many distractions, or
restricted by Resolve if the conflict has become mentally fatiguing.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id252" id="resolving-attacks" name="resolving-attacks">Resolving Attacks</a></h4>
<p>A successful attack inflicts an amount of stress on its target equal to the
number of shifts on the attack (the difference between the attacker’s effort,
and the defender’s effort). Stress represents non-specific dif ficulties a
character can encounter in a conflict.</p>
<p>In a fight, it’s bruising, minor cuts, fatigue, and the like. In a social
conflict, it’s getting flustered or being put off one’s game. In a mental
conflict, stress might mean losing focus or running in circles.</p>
<p>Stress can usually be shaken off once a character has some time to gather
himself, between scenes.</p>
<p>The type of stress that a character takes in a conflict should be appropriate
to the type of conflict. Every character has two stress tracks. The first is
the Health stress track, used for physical stress, such as wounds and fatigue.
The second is the Composure stress track, representing the ability to “keep it
together” in the face of social and mental injuries.</p>
<p>A character can only take so much stress before being unable to go on, represented by a stress track filling up. Each stress track defaults to 5 boxes,
but the tracks can be increased by certain skills: Endurance can increase the
Health stress track, and Resolve can increase the Composure stress track.  See
the skill descriptions of Endurance and Resolve on page XX and page XX for more
details.</p>
<p>When stress is determined, the character should mark off that box on the
appropriate stress track. For instance, if the character takes a three-point
physical hit, he should mark off the third box from the left on the Health
stress track.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>At the end of a scene, unless the GM says otherwise, a character’s stress
tracks clear out; minor scrapes and bruises, trivial gaffes and embarrassments, and momentary fears pass away. Deeper issues resulting from attacks,
called consequences, may last beyond the end of the scene, and are covered
further below.</p>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id253" id="consequences" name="consequences">Consequences</a></h5>
<p>Stress is a transitory thing, but sometimes conflicts will have lasting consequences – injuries, embarrassments, phobias and the like. These are collectively called consequences, and they are a special kind of aspect. We’ll talk more about what this means shortly.</p>
<p>Any time a character takes stress, he may opt not to check off a box and instead take a consequence. If the character takes a hit which he doesn’t have a box for, either because it’s higher than the number of boxes on his stress track, or because it rolls up past his last box, the character must take a consequence.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the consequence should depend upon the conflict – an injury might be appropriate for a physical struggle, an emotional state might be apt for a social one. Whatever the consequence, it is written down under the stress track. The first consequence a character takes is a mild consequence, the second is a moderate consequence, and any additional consequences are severe.  (To understand exactly what these mean, “Removing Consequences”, page XX .)</p>
<p>Normally, the person taking the consequence gets to describe what it is, so long as it’s compatible with the nature of the attack that inflicted the harm.  The GM acts as an arbitrator on the appropriateness of a consequence, so there may be some back and forth conversation before a consequence is settled on. The GM is the final authority on whether a player’s suggested consequence is reasonable for the circumstances and severity.</p>
<p>Characters may only carry three consequences at a time (barring certain stunts which allow more). If the character has already taken a severe consequence, then the only remaining option is to be taken out. We’ll talk about that next.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing about consequences being a special kind of aspect: As long as the consequences are on the character’s sheet, they may be compelled or tagged (or invoked!) like any other aspect. This also means that opponents may start tagging those aspects pretty easily, since it’s no secret that the consequence aspects are now on the character’s sheet!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id254" id="taken-out" name="taken-out">Taken Out</a></h5>
<p>If a character takes a hit which takes him past a severe consequence, that character is taken out. The character has decisively lost the conflict, and unlike the other levels of consequence, his fate is in the hands of his opponent, who may decide how the character loses. The outcome must remain within the realm of reason – very few people truly die from shame, so having someone die as a result of a duel of wits is unlikely, but having them embarrass themselves and flee in disgrace is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>The option to determine how a character loses is a very powerful ability, but there are a few limits on it.</p>
<p>First, the effect is limited to the character who has been taken out. The victor may declare that the loser has made an ass of himself in front of the king, but he cannot decide how the king will respond (or even if the king was particularly bothered).</p>
<p>Second, the manner of the taken out result must be limited to the scope of the conflict. After the victor wins a debate with someone, he cannot decide that the loser concedes his point and the loser gives him all the money in his pockets – money was never part of the conflict, so it’s not an appropriate part of the resolution.</p>
<p>Third, the effect must be reasonable for the target. People do not (normally) explode when killed, so that cannot be a part of taking someone out. Similarly, a diplomat at the negotiating table is not going to give the victor the keys to the kingdom – that’s probably beyond the scope of his authority, and even if it’s not, it’s unlikely something he would give away under any circumstances.  What he will do is make a deal that is very much in the victor’s favor and
possibly even thank him for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, players are not always comfortable with being on the receiving end of this and may, if they wish, spend all the fate points they have left (minimum one) and demand a different outcome, and the GM (or winning character) should then make every effort to allow them to lose in a fashion more to their liking.  That said, if this is a real concern, the loser may want to concede somewhere before things reach this point (see “Concessions”, below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id255" id="concessions" name="concessions">Concessions</a></h5>
<p>Any time a character takes a consequence, he also has the option of offering a concession. A concession is essentially equivalent to surrendering, and is the best way to end a fight before someone is taken out (short of moving away and ending the conflict). The character inflicting the damage can always opt to not take the concession, but doing so is a clear indication that the fight will be a bloody one (literally or metaphorically). If the GM declares that the concession was a reasonable offer, then the character who offered it gains one fate point, and the character who refused it loses one.</p>
<p>The concession is an offer of the terms under which the character is taken out.  If the concession is accepted, the conceding character is immediately taken out, but rather than letting the victor determine the manner of his defeat, he is defeated according to the terms of his concession.</p>
<p>Many conflicts end with a concession when one party or the other simply does not want to risk taking moderate or severe consequences as a result of the conflict, or when neither party wants to risk a taken out result that might come at too high a price.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id256" id="optional-rule-grit" name="optional-rule-grit">Optional Rule: Grit</a></h6>
<p>Some NPCs may be listed as having a certain amount of grit, usually rated at 1
or 2. This represents how committed the character is to the conflict at hand,
and is the number of consequences the character will take before offering a
concession. It is fairly rare for a character to be willing to go to the mat
over trivial matters, so grit is somewhat contextual. If the matter ends up
being of direct importance to the NPC, his grit might be considered to be
higher, but if the matter is trivial, his grit might be considered to be lower.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id257" id="removing-consequences" name="removing-consequences">Removing Consequences</a></h5>
<p>Consequences will fade with time – characters heal, rumors die down, and
distance brings perspective. How long this takes depends upon the severity of
the consequence, which in turn depends upon how it was received.</p>
<p>Mild consequences are removed any time the character has the opportunity to
sit down and take a breather for a few minutes. These consequences will last
until the end of the current scene, and will usually be removed after that. The
only exception is if there is no break between scenes – if the character
doesn’t get a chance to take five, the consequence will remain in place.</p>
<p>&lt;Examples&gt;</p>
<p>Moderate consequences require the character get a little more time and
distance. A good night’s sleep or other extended period of rest and relaxation
is required. Moderate consequences remain in place until the character has had
the opportunity to take several hours (at least 6) of “downtime.” This may mean
getting sleep in a comfortable bed, spending time with a charming member of the
opposite sex, reading by the fire, or anything else of that ilk, so long as
it’s appropriate to the consequence. An afternoon of hiking might be a great
way to get past a Heartbreak consequence, but it’s not a great choice for a Bad
Ankle.</p>
<p>&lt;Examples&gt;</p>
<p>Severe consequences require substantial downtime, measured in days or weeks.
Generally this means that such a consequence will linger for the duration of a
session, but will be cleared up before the next adventure begins.</p>
<p>&lt;Examples&gt;</p>
<p>If the character is in back-to-back sessions where no in-game time passes
between them, such as in a multi-part adventure, he gets a break – any consequences he begins the session with are treated as one level lower for how
quickly they’re removed.</p>
<p>&lt;Examples&gt;</p>
<p>Some skills (such as Science, page XX) and stunts (such as Bounce Back, page XX)  can also reduce recovery time, as described in their write-ups.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id258" id="resolving-maneuvers" name="resolving-maneuvers">Resolving Maneuvers</a></h4>
<p>There are three types of maneuvers – uncontested maneuvers (without an opponent), scene-altering maneuvers, and maneuvers that target another character.</p>
<p>If the maneuver is uncontested – for instance, the character is trying to grab an idol or swing from a rope – it is a simple action, resolved just like any other simple action. The GM sets a difficulty, and the character rolls his skill and applies the resulting shifts as normal.</p>
<p>A maneuver can alter the scene in some way. How hard this is to do can range from trivial (knocking over a candle in a hay loft to add an “On Fire!” aspect to the scene) to virtually impossible (flapping one’s arms very hard to try to remove the “Foggy” aspect from a scene .) Whatever the result, the GM can decide whether or not the change the character makes merits adding or removing an aspect to the scene. The expenditure of a fate point can usually make a reasonable argument for making such a change; if the player’s willing to spend the point, his character’s actions to remove the aspect are invested with an unusual potency.</p>
<p>If the target is another character, the maneuvering character and the target make opposed rolls, using whatever skills the GM deems appropriate.  Success is usually achieved if the maneuvering character generates at least one shift. A successful maneuver may add a temporary aspect to the targeted character; the target can either accept the temporary aspect, or spend a fate point to avoid accepting it. An aspect that results from a maneuver is temporary and does not last very long – we’ll get to the duration in a moment. The temporary aspect may then be tagged for a bonus on a subsequent roll. The first tag usually doesn’t cost the tagging player a fate point, but subsequent tags usually do (see the Aspects chapter, page XX, for more on the methods of tagging aspects).  If a character is simply trying to increase the difficulty of another target’s action, this is considered a block action, and should be resolved as such; see page XX.</p>
<p>Manuevers can also have other special effects, as determined by the GM.  Some
examples of these kinds of maneuvers are given later in this chapter.</p>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id259" id="temporary-aspects" name="temporary-aspects">Temporary Aspects</a></h5>
<p>Temporary aspects that result from maneuvers are usually fragile. A fragile
aspect only exists for a single tag, and may even be cleared away by a simple
change of circumstances. Consider someone who uses a maneuver to take aim at a
target, placing an “In My Sights” aspect on the target. Once the shot’s taken,
the aim goes away – this is clearly fragile. But it could get lost even before
the first shot, if the character who (likely unwittingly) has the aspect on him
manages to break line of sight or move significantly. Fragile temporary aspects
are usually much easier to justify and pass muster with the GM.</p>
<p>Some aspects that result from maneuvers can be sticky. (Aspects that result
from assessments or declarations, explained on page XX, are also usually sticky
.) Sticky aspects don’t go away after they’re first tagged, allowing people to
spend fate points to continue to tag them. The GM is encouraged to be much
more picky about whether or not to allow a sticky aspect to result from a
maneuver.</p>
<p>In many cases, the GM may require that the maneuvering character use spin (see
page XX) in order to succeed at placing a sticky aspect. Sticky aspects may be
easier to place on a location or scene than on another character, especially
when they potentially offer complications to everyone present, on both sides –
such as a maneuver to add an “On Fire!” aspect to a scene.  It may be possible
to remove a sticky aspect via a successful manuever.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id260" id="some-example-maneuvers" name="some-example-maneuvers">Some Example Maneuvers</a></h6>
<p>This is not a comprehensive list of all possible maneuvers, but the examples
provided below should cover a wide range of circumstance and provide the tools
needed to cover unexpected situations.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Blinding</dt>
<dd>Whether it’s throwing sand in someone’s eyes, spraying someone with a harsh
chemical or tossing a can of paint in his face, the goal is the same: keep
him from being able to see. This likely involves the attacker rolling Weapons
and the defender rolling Athletics, with the maneuver succeeding if the
attacker gets at least one shift. A successful maneuver puts the aspect
“Blinded” on the target, which may be compelled to add to the defense of
their target, or to cause them to change the subject or direction of an
action. It can’t force them to take an action they don’t want to (so a
blinded character can’t be compelled to walk off a cliff if the character is
not moving around).</dd>
<dt>Disarming</dt>
<dd>A successful disarm maneuver forces the target to drop his weapon or
otherwise renders the weapon temporarily useless. The target must either
spend an action to become re-armed, or pick up the weapon as a supplemental
action. A supplemental action is normally a -1 penalty to the main action,
but when a disarm maneuver is used, the shifts on the maneuver increase the
penalty. For example, if the disarm attempt succeeds with three shifts, when
the target tries to recover his weapon, he’ll be at -4 (-1 for the usual
penalty, plus an additional -3) to his action that exchange – essentially the
disarm maneuver has resulted in a block. His defensive rolls are not directly
affected by this penalty, but they are indirectly affected; without a weapon
in hand, he can’t use the Weapons skill to defend (Athletics and Fists are
still options).</dd>
<dt>Indirect Attacks</dt>
<dd>Sometimes a character wants to do something like push a stack of boxes down
on an opponent, or scatter marbles across the floor to trip him up. While
this can potentially be an attack, it is usually meant as an inconvenience.
If it’s an attack, it’s treated like any other attack. If it’s an
inconvenience, the attacker has two options. The first option is to make an
opposed roll (such as Might to knock over the bookcase versus Athletics to
dodge) and generate at least one shift, allowing a temporary aspect (such as
“Pinned”) to be placed on the target. The other option is to create a block
(such as using Might to knock over the bookcase, with the value of the roll
representing the block strength created by the scattered books, causing an
opponent to have to roll Athletics in order to move through the mess).</dd>
<dt>Carrying</dt>
<dd>When the character carries something heavy, the penalty for a supplemental
action is increased by the weight factor of the target (see page XX) for each
zone he moves.</dd>
<dt>Pushing</dt>
<dd>Pushing a target requires a successful attack (usually Fists or Might) and
must generate a number of shifts equal to the weight of the target +1 for
each zone the target will be pushed (the +1 is basically the usual -1 for
moving). While a throw or knockback moves the target to a different zone, a
push moves both the target and the acting character into the destination.
Because of this, the “cost” in shifts for pushing remains flat, while the
cost for body-throwing and knockback increases over distance (see below). Any
applicable border conditions affect the roll to push.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Throw or Knockback</dt>
<dd>It’s possible for a character to knock something or someone away from
himself, without moving. Knockback covers any maneuver that can accomplish
this, including throws. To knock something back one zone requires the
maneuver have a success of 1 plus the weight factor of the target (a normal
person has a weight factor of 2, see page XX)).  Each additional zone costs
as much as the previous zone did, plus one, so that the cost increases
dramatically over distance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Marking</dt>
<dd>Every now and again a character just needs to carve his initial on someone’s
chest, as simple as that. While it’s not a damaging attack, it’s a
demoralizing one, and it adds a temporary aspect “Marked” which can be tagged
to take advantage of the opponent’s reduced morale or appearance.  The attack
and defense roll for this is whatever’s appropriate to the situation –
probably Weapons versus Athletics.</dd>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id261" id="minions" name="minions">4.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minions</a></h3>
<p>The term minions is used to refer to the large number of “faceless” followers
of more important, “named” characters in a scene. The named characters are the
villains of the piece; the minions are the bodies of the faithful (or at least
the hapless) that the heroes must climb over to take on the named characters.</p>
<p>Minions have two important statistics, quality and quantity. The GM may build
their villains’ minion mobs using stunts – see page XX – but should feel free
to be a little loose with the rules if looking to size the minions
appropriately to the opposition.</p>
<p>Minions may be either Average, Fair or Good quality. This quality denotes their
base effectiveness in one sort of conflict (physical, social or mental), as
well as their capacity for stress. Average minions can take one box of stress,
Fair can take two, and Good can take three.</p>
<p>The quantity of minions is simply the number of minions present, but together,
minions act in one or more groups, each of which is treated as single
characters in a conflict. This allows the GM to minimize the number of die
rolls she’s making, even when her heroes are facing off against a group of
twenty frothing cultists. This shorthand technique also makes it a touch easier
for the heroes to eliminate several minions in a single action.</p>
<p>Minions who act together as a group are much more effective than individual
minions. When there are two or three minions in a group, the group receives a
+1 bonus to act and react. If there are four to six minions in a group, the
bonus is +2; seven to nine minions get a +3 bonus, and any single group with
ten or more members gets +4.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, when a GM has a large number of minions, she should split
them up into several smaller groups – preferably one group for each player
character they face. These groups don’t necessarily need to be equal in number;
sometimes it makes sense to pit the largest group of minions against the most
capable opponent.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>When minions take stress, it is applied sequentially (i .e ., filling all boxes
instead of just a single one). Damage that overflows one minion is applied to
the next minion. This means a solid enough effort can take out an entire swath
of minions.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id262" id="mixed-groups" name="mixed-groups">Mixed Groups</a></h4>
<p>One of the main uses for minions, be they ninjas or yes-men, is to improve the
effectiveness of their leader. Whenever a named character and a group of
minions are attacking the same target, they are considered to be attached.
This has two benefits for the leader: he receives a bonus based on the group
size (including him), and damage is applied to minions before it’s applied to
him. It has no benefits for the minions, who give up their ability to act
independently, but that’s more or less their job (see the Leadership skill for
more, page XX). Leaving or attaching to a group is a free action, and a
character may detach from a group automatically by moving away from it.</p>

<p>Companions are characters who are a little more important than minions
but are not quite full-fledged named characters in their own right. They are
attached to named characters in the same way minion groups are, and grant
a +1 in appropriate conflicts due to group size. Companions do not have
stress boxes, like minions do; instead, they give the character the ability to
withstand an additional consequence – specifically, the consequence that
the Companion is taken out, kidnapped, or otherwise removed from the
conflict.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Companions are either granted as a short-term story element by the GM, or are
established through the purchase and use of a number of stunts. By default, a
companion is of Average quality and can assist in one type of conflict. The
type of conflict that the Companion can assist with determines her type.</p>
<p>A companion can have a number of advances, with each advance making her more
capable. Usually, when a named character gains a sidekick, aide, or assistant
(through a stunt), the companion gets a number of advances to begin with, and
the named character can buy more advances with additional stunts.</p>
<p>An advance can do one of the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Quality</dt>
<dd>Improve the quality of a companion by one step (from Average to Fair, Fair to
Good, and so on). This advance may be taken several times up to the
companion’s maximum quality, one step lower than that of her partner.
(characters usually top out at Superb, so the most one of their companions
could be is Great.)</dd>
<dt>Scope</dt>
<dd>Improve the scope of a companion, allowing them to assist in an additional
type of conflict (e.g., Physical and Mental, Physical and Social, Social and
Mental). This may be taken twice, allowing the companion to be effective in
all three scopes.</dd>
<dt>Independent</dt>
<dd>The companion is able to act independently of her partner, allowing the
character to send the companion off to perform tasks. An independent
companion is treated as a minion if she’s caught out on her own (quality in
this case indicates her capacity for stress), and is not useful for much
unless she’s also skilled (see below).</dd>
<dt>Skilled</dt>
<dd>The companion may buy skills of her own. If attached, the companion may use
these skills on behalf of her partner, instead of the partner using his skill
at his rating. If the companion has also taken the Independent advance
(above), the Skilled advance the companion can also use these skills when not
attached. One advance can buy one skill at the companion’s quality, two
skills at quality -1, or three skills at quality -2. The Skilled advance can
be bought multiple times, but a different skill or set of skills must be
chosen each time.</dd>
<dt>Keeping up</dt>
<dd>If the companion’s patron has a means of locomotion or stealth that makes it
hard for the companion to keep up with him, then the companion with this
advance has a similar ability, but it is useful only for keeping up with her
patron when attached, and for no other purpose.</dd>
<dt>Communication</dt>
<dd>The companion has some means of communicating with her patron in even the
strangest of circumstances – using secret decoder rings, ancient Atlantean
secrets of telepathic trances, or what-have-you. This isn’t a guarantee, and
without an aspect invested in a companion, a player isn’t going to get
compensated on the occasion that the GM decides to short out the method of
communication.  Still, GMs should think twice before cutting off a character
from his companion, when this advance is in play.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While characters are not obliged to take their companion as an aspect, it is
highly recommended. Companions are the first people villains choose as hostages
and targets, and by choosing to take an appropriate aspect, the player ensures
that he’ll be rewarded for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Unspoken in the above is a simple assumption, which you may choose to make use
of or ignore as you see fit, and it’s this: minions are for bad guys – or at
least NPCs – while companions are for the players. There will most certainly be
exceptions – companions are the most able to show up in both – but very often
it simply isn’t thematically appropriate for a player’s character to run
about with twenty-odd minions at his beck and call. A plucky sidekick, on the
other hand, is entirely in keeping…</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id265" id="overflow" name="overflow">4.3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overflow</a></h3>
<p>When a character takes an action (an attack or a maneuver) against groups of
minions, he will occasionally succeed by far more than anticipated. This leaves
him in a situation where he has a large number of “wasted” shifts.  These
surplus shifts are called overflow, and can be used in an immediate, follow-up
action so long as it’s not as another attack or other offensive maneuver. To
put it simply, overflow is used to take supplemental actions.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>When fighting “named” (non-minion) characters, overflow exists only as the
number of shifts that are left over after the minimum number are used to
produce a taken out (or consequence-producing) result.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id266" id="spin" name="spin">4.3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin</a></h3>
<p>In its broadest sense, spin is a special effect that occurs whenever a character scores a significant or better success (3 shifts or more). That special
effect may simply be color – it may mean the character looks particularly cool,
or is due some recognition for excellence. However, in some cases, gaining spin
can result in an actual game effect.</p>
<p>Specific to combat, spin is a minor, defensive form of overflow (see above)
used to represent minor changes in the cadence of a conflict. Applied to a
defense, when a character who successfully defends against an attack roll by
three or more, he gains spin.</p>
<p>Having gained spin, the character has the option to apply a bonus or penalty to
the next roll that occurs. Defensive spin must be used on the very next action
taken by anyone in the scene (whether it’s a hero’s action or villain’s
action). Used this way, spin either adds one or subtracts one from any roll
involved in that action (e.g., either the attack roll or the defense roll).</p>
<p>The player who gained spin on his defense chooses how that spin works into the
scene. Thus, the only qualifier for using spin is that the character must
explain how he was able to help or hinder, even if it’s just as simple as
shouting some encouragement or providing a distraction. A player might not
always be able to justify using spin. Spin that isn’t used on the next action
simply goes away.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Note that spin, when used, is an effect that occurs instead of overflow. For
example, someone might succeed on a defense by 3 shifts, generating spin.  He
could use his spin to give someone else a +1 as described above, or he could
instead treat those three shifts as overflow, using it to dive clear of an
impending explosion, or some other supplemental action.</p>
<p>Spin may affect certain maneuvers; see “Temporary Aspects” earlier in this
chapter (page XX). And there are other applications of spin, found throughout
this book. In general, spin serves as an easy way of making note that a
character has done particularly well on a roll. In particular, skill and stunt
uses might also create spin and utilize spin in special ways; see the
individual descriptions for more details. The “+1 on the next action” effect of
spin, however, only occurs as a result of a defensive roll in a con flict. This
is because defensive rolls don’t usually get to use shifts when they succeed ;
spin allows for a particularly good roll to be recognized, and not to go
“wasted”.</p>

<p>In the Aspects chapter, we’ve already talked about tagging scene aspects for
bonuses. Another thing that scene aspects can be used for is the occasional
use of one skill in lieu of another, in a way that skill wouldn’t normally be
used. To do so, invoke the aspect (spend a fate point) to create a reasonable
justification for the unusual skill’s use; the character may use the new skill
for as long as the GM considers appropriate. If the new skill has a dramatic
impact that is potent for its novelty, it is probably only appropriate for one
roll, but sometime the skill may be appropriate for the entire scene.</p>

<p>This chapter is focused on getting an idea of what each skill does and why
someone might want a particular one for a character. This means that the
information offered here is player-focused; it offers a “I have this, what can
I do with this” perspective.</p>
<p>Skills can be enhanced by the addition of stunts; stunts are covered in their
own chapter (page XX).  There are also additional concerns for the GM involving
adjudication of the use of these skills; that’s covered in the chapter on
“Running the Game” (page XX).</p>
<p>Here, each skill has a description of what it does, and a write-up of how it is
most commonly used.</p>
<p>Each skill also has a number of trappings, which are the rules for how to use
the skill in certain specific circumstances. Whenever you  encounter a
trapping, you’ll see  the eye glyph ◉  next to it. We’ve given these
circumstances names in order to make them easier to  reference. In some ways,
trappings are like stunts which anyone with the skill can perform. The specific
rules governing setting difficulties for these various trappings of a skill are
not covered here. You’ll find those guidelines in the Running the Game chapter
(starting on page XX, but we’ll cross-reference it for you on a per-skill
basis). Here, we’re simply focusing on giving you an idea of what the trappings
are.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id269" id="assessment-and-declaration" name="assessment-and-declaration">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment and Declaration</a></h2>
<p>Skills can sometimes be combined (see page XX). It’s also possible to use one
skill to set up a situation that another skill can take advantage of, via
maneuvers and temporary aspects (see page XX). Finally, skills can sometimes be
used in partnership with one another, via assessments and declarations.</p>
<p>Sometimes skills will be used in careful assessment well in advance of taking
action – maybe as part of putting together a plan, or simply observing the
target long enough to learn something that would be a critical advantage.  This
approach is most often used with skills that have an element of perception –
including Investigation, Empathy, and even Burglary. Here, the skill is not
used to place a temporary aspect so much as discover an existing one. The
character making the assessment still can tag this aspect for free, but is
still subject to the usual limitations of a free tag – they must do so
immediately after revealing it. This usually means that the free tag must be
taken within the same scene as the assessment or, if the assessment takes
longer than a scene to perform, in the scene which immediately follows.  This
provides a reward to balance out the time the player might otherwise spend
talking through a more cautious plan.</p>
<p>All assessment efforts require the use of a significant chunk of time, usually
indicated in the skill write-up. This can allow skills that usually can’t come
to bear in more time pressure environments (like a fight) to come to bear
thanks to the time invested in advance.</p>
<p>Perception skills only allow the discovery of what already exists. By contrast,
knowledge skills will often allow declaration – in other words, using a
knowledge skill successfully can allow a player to introduce entirely new facts
into play, and then use those facts to his advantage. The new facts take the
form of a temporary aspect. The GM is encouraged to use creativity as her
primary guideline, when judging the use of knowledge skills. Creative and
entertaining facts will be more likely to result in a successful use of a
knowledge skill, and thus give rise to a temporary aspect, than boring facts
will. For example, an anthropologist with a solid Academics skill might use the
declaration ability to state new truths about a tribe the characters have just
encountered – and if successful, suddenly the scene or the tribe has an aspect
on it in keeping with the fact the player just invented. As with maneuvering
and assessment, the first tagging of this aspect is free.</p>
<p>Unlike assessment, declaration doesn’t take any actual in-game time at all –
just the knowledge skill to make use of it.</p>
<div class="admonition-example-for-declaration admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Example for Declaration</p>
<p class="last">A player, whose character is an expert in architecture, attempts declaration: "Many houses of this type have historically had secret doors in the bedrooms to escape police pursuit"  The GM allows it, the player succeeds at the roll and 'creates' a secret door that the GM didn't plan.  The player and the GM discuss where it ought to lead, etc.  PC: "There might be a secret door somewhere near this wall... &lt;thump thump&gt; ah, here it is!  Now, to find out how to open it..."</p>
</div>
<p>Any aspects brought into play by these methods do not have to go away after
they’re used, if the GM wishes them to persist (or if circumstances merely make
it reasonable that they hang around). Any subsequent uses of such aspects,
however, will cost (or grant!) a fate point, as usual. This does mean that
occasionally maneuvers and assessments and declarations will backfire, leading
to a compel. Since aspects are involved, such things are easily double-edged!</p>
<p>Finally, when dealing with a target that has multiple aspects on it due to
assessment and/or declaration, it is not possible to use multiple “free” tags
at the same time. On a given roll, only one “free” tag may be used. Fate points
may be spent to tag the other aspects that have been assessed or declared on
the same roll, and later rolls may use other free tags.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id270" id="academics" name="academics">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academics</a></h2>
<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Academics is a knowledge skill. It measures the character’s “book learning”.
Any knowledge that would not explicitly fall under Science, Mysteries, or Art
falls under this skill (though some overlap may exist among all of those).
Characters with high Academics include scholars of antiquity, professors and
know-it-alls.</p>
<p>The main use of Academics is to answer a question. Questions covered by
Academics include those of history, literature, sociology or any of the “soft”
sciences – in short, most information that is neither art nor science.</p>
<p>The player can ask the GM “What do I know about this subject?” or “What does
this mean?” Often, there will be no need to roll, especially if the subject is
within the character’s specialty (see Scholar, page XX) but if the GM feels the
information is something that should be hard to attain (such as a clue) then
she may call for a roll against a difficulty she sets. If the character
succeeds, he receives the information. If he fails, he does not, but he may
still attempt to research the topic (see below) – or, perhaps more
entertainingly, may stumble onto a false lead that gets him deeper into
trouble.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id271" id="o-research-academics" name="o-research-academics">5.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Research [Academics]</a></h3>
<p>Researching a topic is frequently a time-consuming and arduous task, and
exactly the sort of thing worth skimming over with a few quick dice rolls.  It
is treated as an extension of what knowledge the character has – he can answer
some questions off the top of his head, and other questions because he knows
what book to find the answer in.</p>
<p>As such, research is something that can happen when a character fails an
Academics check. Provided the researcher is willing to spend time researching
(and that the answer can be found) the only question is how long it will take
and how good a library they have access to (more on libraries in a bit).</p>
<p>One important note: because the GM is not always obligated to reveal the
difficulty of a given roll, players may not know how much they failed it by,
which means they don’t know how long they’ll need to research. Usually they’ll
just research until they find the answer, but sometimes, when time is tight,
they may be limited to less time. GMs are encouraged to read “Setting
Difficulties” (page XX) before making any decision about how to deal with a
failed roll.</p>
<p>Academic research requires a library. The quality of the library determines the
hardest possible question that can be answered within it (so a question of Good
difficulty requires a Good library or better). If a character is attempting to
answer a question in a library that’s not equipped to answer it, the GM is
encouraged to be up-front about its shortcomings.</p>
<p>Most schools and private individuals have Mediocre, Average, or Fair
libraries. Small colleges often have Good libraries while larger institutions
may have Great ones. Superb and better libraries are few and far between.
Many Libraries also have a specialty or two where they are considered one
step higher – for example, Georgetown’s library specializes in law, so it has
a Great Library, which is treated as Superb for questions of law. Characters
may own libraries of their own; see the Resources skill (page XX) for
more.</p>

<p>Sometimes the GM just needs to give the group a lot of information, and the
character with a high knowledge skill tends to be the conduit of that.  When
the GM needs to drop a lot of information on the group, she may ask the
character with the most knowledge if she can use them as a mouthpiece. Assuming
the player agrees, the GM can share all appropriate background, and is
encouraged to give the player a fate point for having his character temporarily
commandeered by the GM.</p>

<p>The character may use his knowledge to declare facts, filling in minor details
which the GM has not mentioned. These facts must be within the field of
Academics, and the GM has the right to veto them. However, if the GM is all
right with it, she may let the player make a declaration and roll Academics
against a difficulty she sets. If successful, the fact is true, and if not, the
character is mistaken. Like most Academics rolls, the GM may or may not wish to
share the difficulty, so the character may not know if he succeeded.</p>
<p>This is a straight up declaration action, as described earlier (see page XX).
If the academic or another character takes action based on the declared fact,
that person can tag the aspect that has been introduced. If the academic is
wrong, there is no penalty, but there may be complications – at her option, the
GM could place a temporary “mistaken” aspect on the academic, compelling it to
represent the fall-out (and netting the mistaken academic a fate point!). If
the academic was right, the aspect is placed, and is taggable as described
earlier – first one being free.</p>

<p>Languages are part of a good classical education. A character may speak a
number of additional languages based on his Academics score. Each step of
Academics above Mediocre gives the character knowledge of one additional
language (so one at Average, two at Fair, and so on). The player does not need
to choose the languages when the character is created; instead, he may simply
choose languages in the course of play, as is convenient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<p>Under normal circumstances, the character may know the answer or not, but will
not get a wrong answer. A wrong answer should only be a result of one of two
things. First, it may be the result of the compelling of an aspect – the player
may be offered a fate point for his character to go haring off on a tangent or
to reach the wrong conclusion. Alternately, it may be as a result of an active
deception, such as someone planting bad information.</p>
<p>To plant bad information, a character must decide what question (in general)
they’re providing false information about. The character must have access to
the target’s library (see Research, page XX) and make an Academics roll
modified by Deceit (see “Combining Skills”, page XX) in addition to whatever
rolls he may need to get in and out of the place where the information is
stored.</p>
<p>The result of that roll is the difficulty to spot the false information. When
someone tries to discover information that is affected by this deception, he
must make an Academics roll as usual. If that roll less than the difficulty set
by the deception, then the false information is discovered one step earlier
than the real information might be. If the failure is significant (missing the
mark by three or more), then the true information may simply be unavailable. If the researcher meets or exceeds the roll for the deception, he finds
the false information and recognizes it for what it is.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Alertness is a measure of the character’s regular, passive level of awareness.
Specifically, it is the perception skill to notice things the character is not
looking for. In an exchange where characters are surprised (and as such, are
prevented from choosing which skill to roll), Alertness is the skill which is
rolled. In conflicts of an active, physical nature, Alertness determines initiative. Characters with high Alertness include bodyguards, outdoorsmen
and criminals of a sneaky variety.</p>
<p>Players will rarely ask to roll Alertness – if they are actively looking for
something, Investigation is usually more appropriate. Alertness is more
appropriate for things that players and characters do not expect or are not
looking for, such as whether they notice a surprise, or if they happen to
spot a hidden clue. In short, it is reactive perception. As such, it’s a skill
that, more often, the GM calls for people to roll.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id277" id="o-avoiding-surprise-alertness" name="o-avoiding-surprise-alertness">5.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Avoiding Surprise [Alertness]</a></h3>
<p>Whenever ambushed (see Stealth, page XX), a character may make one
final Alertness check against the Stealth of his attacker, in order to see if
he is surprised. If he fails this check, his defense skill is considered to be
Mediocre for the first exchange.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Art measures the character’s overall artistic ability, covering the gamut of
endeavors, from painting to dance to music. This includes knowledge,
composition, and performance. Characters with high Art include artists
(obviously), aristocrats, and those of the avant garde.</p>
<p>Art is usually either used as a knowledge skill, for knowledge about art,
artists, and what it takes to make art, or as a crafting skill, to create a
work of art, or as a social skill to entertain.</p>

<p>As a knowledge skill, Art is basically identical to Academics, though the
fields it applies to are more limited and more focused – a few shifts of
success on an Art roll may “pay out” more information than if someone
applied Academics to the same art-related problem.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id280" id="o-art-as-craft-art" name="o-art-as-craft-art">5.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Art as Craft [Art]</a></h3>
<p>As a crafting skill, Art is fairly straightforward – characters can make art of
virtually any type of a quality equal to their skill. Without stunts, none of
them will be masterpieces, but any art that’s Mediocre or better can be
displayed without any real embarrassment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, creations must be improvised, and that can be a little more
fast and furious. This usually takes a few minutes, and the character can make
a roll to create their piece. Generally speaking, for the duration of the scene
where it is displayed, the quality of the piece is equal to their roll, with it
degrading one step in each subsequent scene.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id281" id="o-art-as-communication-art" name="o-art-as-communication-art">5.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Art as Communication [Art]</a></h3>
<p>While Academics covers the technical building blocks of communication,
language, grammar and the like, Art covers the expression of ideas, and as
such, covers most means of broad communication, like writing. These are not
“pure” art forms, however, and a character’s other skills play a role in their
application, so a character’s writing is usually modified by their Academics.
There are exceptions, such as dry, academic documents (which use pure
Academics) and poetry (which uses just Art).</p>
<p>Public speaking is a similar creature, but it is more beholden to the charisma
and presence of the speaker – in those cases, Art modifies whatever skill
(Rapport, Intimidate, Leadership or Deceit) the character is using, as long as
there is a creative aspect to the communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id282" id="o-art-as-performance-art" name="o-art-as-performance-art">5.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Art as Performance [Art]</a></h3>
<p>Art can also be used to shape the mood of a group. Whenever a group is exposed
to an artist’s work, such as at a performance or a show, the scene may gain an
aspect appropriate to the performance. Normally, this aspect only remains on
the scene for the duration of the performance, but some stunts allow this to
extend into subsequent scenes.</p>
<p>In effect, this is a declaration on the part of the artist, but limited to
declaring mood and emotional impact, rather than anything specific. In general,
art inspires passion in a broad sense; for example, in may make someone feel
hopeful, but not determine what he’ll feel hopeful about.  When making a
standard performance, any temporary aspects that result – either by treating
the performance as a maneuver, or as an attack yielding consequences – must
also be broad and nonspecific. “Hopeful” is good; “Hopeful That Doktor
Herborn Will Be Defeated” is not. There is an exception; a performance that
very clearly has a target, such as a satire, may plant fairly specific opinions
of a target, with the difficulty based on the status of the target.</p>

<p>Imitation has a long-standing place in the art world, and thus Art is quite
good at making fakes, be they “lost” symphonies or falsified documents.  When a
character uses Art to make a forgery, the difficulty depends on the complexity
of the thing being duplicated. Having an original on hand can help reduce the
difficulty. Deceit should also be used to complement the effort.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>This measures the character’s general physical capability, excepting raw power,
which is a function of Might. Athletics covers running, jumping, climbing, and
other broadly physical activities you might find in a track and field event.
Characters with high Athletics include athletes, soldiers and outdoorsmen.</p>
<p>Athletics is often the “when in doubt” physical skill, and it can get a lot of
use. There’s sometimes confusion as to when to use Athletics and when to use
Might. As a rule of thumb, Athletics is used to move yourself, Might is used to
move other things and people. When an action calls for both, they may modify
one another. If there is no clear indication which should be primary, default
to Athletics as primary and Might as secondary.</p>

<p>This is not the Olympics – jumping is something one does to get over
obstacles or across bottomless chasms, and in those situations the GM will
set a fixed difficulty to be met or exceeded. Generally, that difficulty is
going to be the bare minimum to clear the distance, so beating that by a few
shifts is often a good idea. Outside of that, jumping is often just considered
an extension of normal movement. For GM advice on setting difficulties
and designing jumping challenges, see page XX.</p>

<p>A character may use their Athletics to move faster by taking a sprint action.
Normally, characters may only move one zone on their turn by turning over one
of their shifts as a supplemental action. Characters who spend their entire
action moving are sprinting; rolling Athletics against a target difficulty of
Mediocre, they may cross a number of zones and borders equal to or less than
the total shifts of effect. In the absence of borders, characters can always
move a minimum of one zone. See page XX for additional details.</p>

<p>Athletics is the skill for climbing. The GM will set a difficulty for how hard
it is to climb a given obstacle. At the GM’s option, shifts may be used to
speed the process if the character succeeds. For GM advice on setting
difficulties and designing climbing challenges, see page XX.</p>

<p>Athletics can be used as a defensive skill to respond to attacks in physical
combat, and works very well in conjunction with taking a full defense action
(yielding a +2 to the roll; see page XX). The one important thing to note is
that taking a defense action means that you can’t use Athletics for other
things, like sprinting.</p>

<p>When characters fall, they bypass the physical stress track entirely, and hop
right to a consequence, with the severity of the consequence being determined
by length of the fall. Characters who fall can roll Athletics to try to limit
the severity of the result. For guidelines on the severity of falls, please see

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>The ability to overcome security systems, from alarms to locks, falls under the
auspices of this skill. This also includes knowledge of those systems and the
ability to assess them. Characters with a high Burglary include burglars,
private eyes and even some cops.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id291" id="o-casing-burglary" name="o-casing-burglary">5.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Casing [Burglary]</a></h3>
<p>Burglary can also be used as a very specialized perception skill, specifically
to assess the weaknesses and strengths of a potential target. Here, the
character is trying to determine the existence of inobvious or hidden aspects,
using assessment (see page XX). This usage of Burglary can be blurred together
with something like declaration, if the player comes up with an entertaining
new aspect to place on the target of his future burglaring.  Thus, either the
GM can indicate that some flaw exists and has been discovered, or the player
can make a declaration about a flaw in the security that he intends to defeat.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method, the character then makes a roll against a difficulty
determined by the GM, and if he succeeds, that fact is true, and may grant a +2
bonus to a roll where that information is useful. When a player is making
declarations, casing follows the same guidelines as the minor details trapping
for Academics (page XX), but is limited to security facts (including potential
escape routes). As in either case this reveals an aspect waiting to be tagged,
the first +2 is free, and subsequent uses on other rolls cost a fate point, as
always.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id292" id="contacting" name="contacting">5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacting</a></h2>
<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Contacting is the ability to find things out from people. A character may
know a guy, who knows a guy, or maybe he just knows the right questions
to ask. Whatever his methods, he know hows to find things out by asking
around. Characters with high Contacting include reporters, private eyes
and spies.</p>
<p>A character with a high Contacting skill knows a wide variety of people and has
at least a mild amount of connection with virtually any organization. There are
Contacting stunts which give a character deep ties to a specific field like
crime or business, and those allow a deeper level of contact within that field.</p>
<p>Contacting does not work in a vacuum. The character needs to be able to get out
and talk to people for it to be useful, and when that isn’t possible, neither
is Contacting. Contacting is also limited by familiarity – a character finding
himself in an entirely unfamiliar environment may encounter difficulties
increased by as much as +4. Thankfully, Contacting also covers the skill for
building new social networks, so if a character stays in an area for any amount
of time, he can diminish the difficulty by one per week spent.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id293" id="o-gather-information-contacting" name="o-gather-information-contacting">5.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Gather Information [Contacting]</a></h3>
<p>As with the research trapping from Academics (page XX), gathering information
begins with a question, except the character goes out and talks to people,
trying to find the answer to a question like, “Who’s trying to kill me?” The
player describes where his character is going to talk to folks (usually “the
street”), the GM sets the difficulty, and the player rolls at normal, at which
point the GM passes on whatever the player has discovered. If the Skills roll
fails, then the research time investment table may be applied; instead of
needing a library, the character needs people to talk to. These people must
have the right level of access to answer the question; this corresponds to the
“quality” of a library. If the character is being “shut out” for one reason or
another, no amount of dogged persistence through time investment is going to
help. When that happens, it usually means there’s another problem the player
needs to solve first.</p>
<p>One important warning about authenticity – being the most informed guy and
knowing all the latest gossip isn’t necessarily the same thing.  Contacting
finds out what people know, and people always have their own biases.
Information is only as good as the sources it comes from.  Contacting rarely
tests the veracity of the information provided – save by the discovery, through
several sources, that contradictory answers are coming from different sources.
If a character wants to determine the truthfulness of the information he’s
finding, that’s a more in-depth conversation, and may involve Empathy, Rapport,
Deceit, and more.</p>

<p>Contacting also keeps the character apprised of the general state of things,
and acts as a sort of social Alertness, keeping the character abreast of things
that might be coming his way. It’s far from foolproof, and like Alertness, the
GM is usually the one to call for a roll – a player can’t go out looking for a
tip off (though he can tell the GM he’s going out talking to his contacts just
to check on what’s up, which is a good hint that he’d like a tip off ).</p>

<p>Contacting is also useful for planting rumors, not just for ferreting them out.
The player simply tells the GM what rumor he wants to plant, and the GM may
assign bonuses and penalties based on how preposterous or reasonable the
rumor is. The GM then uses the final roll to determine what the result of the
rumor is.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting: the character’s roll is also the target for someone else’s
Contacting roll to find out who’s been spreading rumors, so be careful!</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Deceit is the ability to lie, simple as that. Be it through word or deed, it’s
the ability to convey falsehoods convincingly. Characters with high Deceit
include grifters, spies, and politicians.</p>
<p>For simple deceptions, a contest between Deceit and an appropriate skill
(usually Empathy, Alertness or Investigation) is all that is necessary, but for
deeper deceptions, like convincing someone of a lie or selling someone the
Brooklyn Bridge, a social conflict is appropriate, complete with Deceit attacks
and social stress being dealt. Sometimes, Deceit is the undercurrent rather
than the forefront of an action, and as such, the skill may be used secondarily
to modify, restrict, or complement another skill’s use.</p>

<p>Deceit does cover disguises, using the disguised character’s Deceit skill
against any attempts to penetrate the disguise. Such disguises are dependant
upon what props are available, and won’t hold up to intense scrutiny
(specifically, an Investigation roll) without the use of stunts, but they’re
fine for casual inspection (Alertness rolls).</p>

<p>A character with Deceit may opt to use Deceit instead of Rapport to defend
against another character using Empathy to get a read on him. This roll is
modified by Rapport.</p>
<p>If the character loses his defense roll, then the Empathy reader may proceed as
usual – in attempting to hide himself, the character has blundered and revealed
a truth. If the character wins the roll, however, he may provide a false aspect
to the reader, sending her off with an utterly fabricated notion of him.</p>
<p>When a character tries to take advantage of an aspect that they falsely think
is there, it can end up being a waste of a fate point or worse! (See Guessing
Aspects, page XX)</p>

<p>Deceit can be used for more than just dodging attention; it can be used to
riposte a social query with a web of deception. When another character
initiates a social contest, including an Empathy read, the character turns the
tables, using his Deceit as an offensive skill, and representing any Skills
particularly convincing lies as consequences. This is a dangerous game
though, as the deceiver is opting not to put his false face forward, and if
his opponent succeeds, he’ll hit upon the truth. However, if the deceiver
outclasses his opponent significantly, this can be a powerful technique.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Drive is the ability to operate a motorcar, one of the greatest inventions of
recent memory. Mister Ford has put these all over the roads of America, and the
first folks truly comfortable behind the wheel are emerging. Why, the most
daring speed-demons among them can make the most of its 20 horsepower, nearing
speeds of 45 miles per hour! Characters with high Drive include chauffeurs,
racers and getaway drivers.</p>
<p>Drive is pretty easy to use. Trying to do something in a car? Roll Drive,
simple as that. If a character trying to do something fancy, like drive and
shoot at the same time, Drive will restrict the skill being used (not modify,
as a high Drive skill won’t make someone a better shot).</p>

<p>Cars inevitably lead to chases, one of the major trappings of this skill. In a
chase, a character’s Drive skill is used to close the distance between him and
the car he’s chasing (or increase the distance if he’s the one being chased!).
It’s also used to bring quick resolution to the issues brought up by terrain
and other obstacles. For an extensive treatment of car chase rules, see the GM

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>This is the ability to understand what other people are thinking and feeling.
This can be handy if a character is trying to spot a liar or wants to tell
someone what that person wants to hear. Empathy is usable as a defense
against Deceit, and is the basis for initiative in a social conflict. Characters

<p>Empathy can be used to figure out what makes another character tick.</p>
<p>Given at least a half hour of intense, personal interaction, a character may
make an Empathy roll against the target’s Rapport roll (see page XX for more on
Empathy vs. Rapport when reading people). This is an assessment action (see
page XX). If he gains one or more shifts on the roll, he discovers one of the
target’s aspects which he is not already aware of. It may not reveal the aspect
in precise detail, but it should paint a good general picture ; for instance,
it might not give the name of the character’s brother, but it will reveal that
there is someone with that relationship. This process may be repeated, taking
longer each time and ultimately can reveal a number of aspects equal to the
character’s Empathy skill’s value (minimum one) – so, a Fair skill (value 2)
would allow two aspects revealed through at least two different rolls.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Endurance is the ability to keep performing physical activity despite fatigue
or injury. It’s a measure of the body’s resistance to shock and effort. In
addition to fatigue, Endurance measures how well a character shrugs off poisons
and disease (for a treatment of poisons, see page XX). Characters with a high
Endurance include explorers, athletes, and sailors.</p>
<p>Endurance is a passive skill. Players will very rarely need to ask to roll
Endurance; instead, the GM will call for rolls when appropriate.</p>
<p>Endurance can particularly come into play in long-term actions, as a secondary,
restricting skill, where the character’s ability to keep performing at peak is
limited by how able he is to overcome fatigue and pain; this is why top
athletes have their Endurance skill on par with (or better than!) their
Athletics skill. Someone without a solid Endurance skill may be a good
sprinter, but will find themselves winded and falling behind in a marathon.</p>
<p>Endurance also determines a character’s Health capacity (the length of a
character’s Health stress track), since Health stress represents physical
wounds and fatigue.</p>
<p>By default, players have 5 boxes for  their Health stress track. Better-than-
Mediocre Endurance increases the number of boxes as shown here.</p>

<p>Engineering is also the skill for unmaking things. Given time and tools, an

<p>A gambler can usually find a game when he’s short on cash – or just in the mood
for sport. Finding a game, or obtaining an invitation to one, requires a
Contacting roll (complemented by Gambling), with a difficulty equal to the
quality of the game (page XX). Characters with the Big Man stunt (see page XX)

such a game is automatically high stakes (see below).</p>
<p>The quality of the game determines the base value of its pot, unless the
gambler declares he’s looking for a high stakes game, in which case the pot is
two steps higher. However, a high stakes game also includes the potential for
complications, like sore losers, or strange table stakes.  Once at the table,
the gambler’s Gambling skill roll will determine if he wins or loses, and if
the pot is bigger than his Resources, that might be a problem. The particulars
of running a Gambling focused scene are covered in the GM’s section, page XX.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id312" id="guns" name="guns">5.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guns</a></h2>
<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Sometimes characters just need to shoot things. Thankfully, there’s a skill for
that. With a gun, characters can shoot up to two zones away – three if it’s a
rifle (borders may or may not count, depending on their nature).
Unfortunately, without a gun in hand, or at least close at hand, the skill
isn’t much use.</p>
<p>Guns can also be used to cover non-gun weapons that shoot at a distance, such
as bows and strange electrical spears that shoot lightning, though usually with
a small penalty. If, at the time the player takes the skill, he decides the
character is focused on using a method of shooting other than a gun, he may
rename this skill to something more appropriate (e .g ., Bows) and instead face
the familiarity penalty when using actual guns. Under such an Skills option,
most Guns stunts are still available (though Two Bow Joe might be a little
tricky).</p>
<p>The Guns skill does not allow characters to defend themselves as well as
attack; it trades the a defense component for ability to act over greater
range. A character who’s both a good shot and good at getting out of the way
will also want to invest in either Athletics or Fists (or both!).</p>
<p>Guns users are also well-versed in a variety of small arms, large arms, and
ammunitions, and may use this skill as a limited sort of knowledge skill
covering those areas.</p>
<p>Characters with high Guns include soldiers, assassins, and hunters.  If someone
is devoted to using Guns as a strong component of their fighting style, it can
safely be assumed that they possess at least one or two guns, regardless of
Resources rating (though whether or not they will be allowed to such things
whereever they go is another matter entirely). This is, of course, subject to
the rigors of character concept and GM approval.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>There are more graceful social skills for convincing people to do what a
character wants, but those skills tend not to have the pure efficiency of
communicating that failing to comply may well result in some manner of harm.
Nothing personal.</p>
<p>Using Intimidation is a blatant social attack, which someone can defend against
with their Resolve. This is the skill for interrogation (as opposed to
interviewing) as well as scaring the bejeezus out of someone. Even without a
basis for fear, Intimidation can occasionally be used as provocation, to
produce a strong “burst” of negative emotional response (such as provoking
someone into a fight, or at least to anger). Regardless, it’s never pretty.</p>
<p>Characters with high Intimidation include mob enforcers, bouncers and “bad”
cops.</p>

<p>If there is a reason for the target to believe that the intimidating character
is capable of harming the target when they can’t do anything about it, such as
if the target is unarmed and the intimidator is wielding a weapon, it is worth
a +1 bonus, +2 if the target is completely helpless. Conversely, if the target
is the armed one, his defense roll is likely at +1, and can be at +2 or more if
the target is very secure in their position (such as being behind something
solid, or having lots of backup). If these circumstances suddenly change, it’s
certainly call for another Intimidation roll!</p>
<p>The lesson here is simple: Intimidation works best from a position of power.
Achieve that position first, then apply the skill.</p>

<p>If things get to the point of a face off, there are a lot of other actions an
opponent can do other than stand there and be intimidated, such as disengage or
pull out a weapon. However, one of the real strengths of Intimidation is at the
first flash of contact, when people instinctively get out of the way of someone
intimidating. Intimidation can establish a powerful, menacing first impression.
If the character is actively doing something intimidating, he may roll a quick
contest of Intimidation against the opponent’s Resolve.  If successful, the
target is taken aback for a moment, generally long enough to brush past them,
though usually with plenty of time to call for help if appropriate. This cannot
be done in a fight, or against any target who is already ready for a fight, but
in those “first contact” situations, Intimidation is gold for control.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Investigation is the ability to look for things and, hopefully, find them. This
is the skill used when the character is actively looking for something, such as
searching a crime scene or trying to spot a hidden enemy. Characters</p>
<p>Investigation is the skill most commonly called for when the character wants to
look for something like clues. It is also useful for eavesdropping or any other
activity where someone is trying to observe something over a period of time.
When looking for deep patterns and hidden flaws, Investigation may be used as
an assessment action (see above, page XX).</p>
<p>This makes Investigation the flipside of Alertness; it is mindful, deliberate
perception, in contrast to Alertness’s passive mode of operation. This also
means that an equivalent Investigation effort is nearly always going to yield
better, more in-depth, information than an Alertness effort would; the downside
is that Investigation is far more time consuming.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Leadership is a multi-faceted skill. A good leader knows how to direct and
inspire people, but he also understands how to run an organization. As such,
the Leadership skill covers acts of both types. Characters with a high
Leadership include military officers, politicians, bureaucrats, and lawyers.</p>

<p>Any organization which the character is in charge of uses his Leadership as its
default value for any question of how organized it is. This establishes the
difficulty for things like bribery or theft, and also gives a general sense of
how quickly and efficiently the organization acts.</p>

<p>A good leader has knowledge of organizations and the rules that govern them,
including knowledge of laws, bribery and other means of dealing with red tape;
this is why Leadership is a key skill for lawyers. Leadership serves as an
all-purpose knowledge skill for knowing how to act in a given organization,
including important things like how much to bribe.</p>

<p>Leadership can be used to direct troops, workers or any other group activity.
Any time the character is in a position to give orders to a group of minions,
he may apply his Leadership as a modifying secondary skill on the minions’
skill roll. In a conflict, offering this assistance takes the character’s
action, but can affect the minions attached to him. While attached minions
cannot normally act, when they are being directed by the character with
leadership, they act as if they were not attached.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>This is a measure of pure physical power, be it raw strength or simply the
knowledge of how to use the strength one has. For lifting, moving and breaking
things, Might is the skill of choice. Might may be used indirectly as well, to
modify, complement, or limit some skill uses. Characters with a high Might
include strongmen, laborers, and lords of the jungle.</p>

<p>In combat, Might can be used to help with particular applications of Fists and
Weapons – if force is a very significant element at play, Might will modify the
primary skill. Furthermore, someone successfully engaging an opponent in a
one-on-one exchange can potentially switch from Fists to Might, if executing a
hold or other wrestling move where it’s less about hitting someone as it is
about overwhelming them with physical force. Such a switch would result from a
maneuver of some sort.</p>

<p>Might is the skill of choice for applying brute force to break things in halves

like. Using Might, items can be damaged over time or broken with a single
dramatic blow. (For guidelines on breaking things, see page XX .)</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>There is more to the world than science has explained yet. Ethereal
photography, mesmerism and other mentalist tricks, rituals of lost pre-Roman
empires, secrets of the distant East – all these and more are known to a master
of Mysteries. Characters with high Mysteries include mystics, explorers, and
adventurous archaeologists.</p>
<p>The actual use of Mysteries is fairly flexible – in appropriate situations it
can serve as a knowledge skill like Academics, a perception skill like
Alertness, or even something else entirely.</p>

<p>The GM may occasionally call upon a character to roll Mysteries in the same way
she might ask for Alertness rolls. As the name implies, this will tend to be
for things that are strange and mysterious, so predicting when it’s applicable
can be hard to do. Occasionally, it may allow the player an assessment action
to discover hidden aspects of a locale that are shrouded in mystic and arcane
ways.</p>

<p>Mysteries can be used for hypnosis. This is more of a parlor trick than
anything else, useful on the weak minded when you’ve got lots of time to put on
a show.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Mesmerism is a basis for a mental conflict, but
practically speaking, both parties need to be willing participants, so it’s not
really a conflict at all. People are hypnotized because they want to be, and
they suffer no lasting consequences. There are no post-hypnotic suggestions or
other mind control tricks (though certain mesmerism-focused Mysteries stunts
break this rule).</p>
<p>Despite those limitations, mesmerism does have some practical uses. First, it
can be useful to recover lost memories. A mesmerist can put another character
in a trance and give them a chance to try to remember a scene more precisely.</p>
<p>Additionally, a Mesmerist can put a willing subject into a calming trance to
help them ignore external distractions. This can be very useful in leading a
panicked arachnophobe though a room full of spiders or the like.</p>

<p>Mysteries can be used in the same way Academics can, for research of

<p>Casting tarot, throwing chicken bones or reading horoscopes – a character can
use Mysteries to try to make guesses about the future. The knowledge gleaned is
never terribly specific, but it allows the player to determine if a course of
action is auspicious. The character should summarize the fortune as best they
can, ideally to something that could go on a fortune cookie. The fortune may be
general (“The cock will crow when the thunder strikes”) or about a specific
target (“You will meet a tall, dark stranger”) but that’s the limit on the
specificity. The GM can guide a player through building a proper fortune, using
her guidelines (page XX).</p>
<p>Fortune-telling is a form of declaration. The character may, once per session,
make a prediction, and make a roll against a difficulty set by the GM.  If the
roll is successful, it’s a true fortune, and there is now an aspect that
represents it. If the target of the fortune was a person, they receive the
temporary aspect for the duration of the adventure. If it was a general
prediction, it is considered to be a scene aspect on every scene for the
duration of the adventure.</p>

<p>The flipside of Intimidation, this is the ability to talk with people in a
friendly fashion and make a good impression, and perhaps convince them to see
one’s side of things. Any time a character wants to communicate without an
implicit threat, this is the skill to use, which makes it appropriate for
interviewing. Characters with high Rapport include grifters, reporters, and
good cops.</p>

<p>Rapport controls the face the character shows to the world, and that
includes what they choose not to show. As such, when a character tries to
use Empathy to get a read on a character, it is opposed by Rapport. If the
character wishes to simply reveal nothing, they may use Rapport and take
the equivalent of a defensive action, gaining a +2 on their roll.</p>
<p>This is over and above the “default” of a Rapport defense because it is openly
obvious: the character is wiping all emotions off of his face. It also requires
that the character be consciously aware that someone’s trying to get a read off
of him. If the character is trying not to look like he’s actively warding off
the read, or isn’t really aware he’s being read, then he isn’t taking a full
defensive action, and does not get the +2.</p>

<p>Characters skilled in Rapport are able to control which side of their
personality is shown to others, seeming to open up while actually guarding
their deepest secrets. Since true things are still revealed about the
character, this is not an inherently deceptive action. When a character opens
up, he defends against an Empathy read with Rapport, as usual. If his opponent
succeeds and generates at least one shift, he finds something out, as usual.
If not, he still discovers an aspect – but it’s one of the defending
character’s choice.</p>
<p>This can effectively be used to stonewall someone without the obvious poker
face of Closing Down. On top of it all, the character opening up can always
choose to reveal something that the other character already knows about.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Resolve is a measure of a character’s self-mastery, as expressed through things
like courage and willpower. It’s an indicator of coolness under fire and also
represents the drive not to quit. It plays a key part in efforts to resist
torture or the strange mental powers of psychic villainy.</p>
<p>Resolve is almost always rolled in response to something, rather than on its
own. Its primary role is as defense against most kinds of social manipulation
or distraction. Resolve also shines in situations which have spun very much out
of control. Characters with a high Resolve have a distinct advantage in
continuing to keep their head about them and respond calmly. Similarly, when
all seems lost, a character with a strong Resolve is often capable of
soldiering on. Resolve is the mental or social parallel to physical Endurance.</p>
<p>Resolve also determines a character’s Composure capacity (the length of the
Composure stress track), indicating the character’s resilience in the face of
mental, emotional, and social stress. By default, players have a Composure
capacity of 5, but they may increase that capacity based upon their Resolve.
Better than Mediocre Resolve adds more boxes to the stress track as shown here.</p>

<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>Usually Resources is simply a measure of available wealth, but the specific form this takes, from a secret family silver mine to a well invested portfolio, can vary from character to character (and may be indicated and enhanced by their aspects). Usually this skill passively informs the GM what the character’s available resources are, but Resources may still be rolled for large expenditures, like purchases and bribes. Some large-scale conflicts may be about trying to out-spend the other guy; here, Resources can act as an attack or defense skill.</p>
<p>Note: characters who have access to a fairly sized organization's resources can act as if they have Resources at Fair and, with the backing of the organization, can potentially make bigger purchases. These expenditures are tracked by the organization, and as such, if subterfuge is important, personal resources are a wiser choice.</p>
<p>Characters with high Resources include robber barons, aristocrats and successful criminals.</p>

<p>The cost of items is measured on the adjective ladder (for an examination of the costs of things, please see page XX). Characters can buy reasonable quantities of anything of a value less than their Resources without worr ying about it. For items greater than or equal to their Resources, they need to roll against the cost of the thing. If successful, the character can afford the item; if not, they can’t. Characters can only make one Resources roll per scene.</p>
<p>Characters are generally assumed to have all the tools they would normally need to do their job, whether that job is fixing engines or shooting people.  Still, sometimes a situation will arise where something needs to be bought.  When that happens, the price is measured in terms of how much Resources it requires.</p>

<p>Part of the passive measure of Resources is the tools and spaces the character has access to. Workspaces are environments where a character can perform a certain type of work, and owning and maintaining a world-class lab or library requires a certain amount of resources.</p>
<p>Characters may use their Resources to set up the tools they need for their job.  A character’s home may have, for free, a single Library, Lab, Workshop, Arcane Library or Arcane workshop of a quality equal to their (Resources-2). As described in Academics, above, the quality of a workplace determines the highest possible difficulty of a “question” or project that can be pursued there.</p>

<p>Science can be used to answer all manner of questions, provided there’s time
and equipment to look into them. A scientist looking to solve a problem should
figure out what question he’s trying to answer, like “What killed this man?” or
“What is this object composed of ?”. The GM will call for a roll to see if the
character can answer the question. This will require a lab of some sort, and
it’s possible that some questions can’t be answered without the right
equipment. In the end, this functions the same as Academics performing research
in a library (see page XX).</p>

<p>Pulp scientists are broadly versed, and this includes a basic understanding of

medicine. See page XX for a discussion of the difficulties in using Science for
medical purposes.</p>

<p>More importantly, Science here means pulp science. Do mathematical equations
Is there a cure for lycantrophy and vampirism? Of course there is, and Dr. Thanatos has a glowing syringe to prove it in his bag! Is phlogiston, the subatomic particle of fire, a valid theory? My friend, not only is it valid, but I’d like to show you my phlotomic bomb!</p>
<p>In practice, this simply means nearly anything can be explained with “Science!”
It may not necessarily make sense to anyone other than the person doing the
explaining, but it at least sounds authoritative, and sometimes it’s even
right. When confronted with a challenge, the character can apply a scientific
explanation, and roll against a difficulty set by the GM. This is a declaration
action. If a character acts in accordance with the resulting scientific advice,
and he succeeds on the roll, he gains a +2 bonus or a reroll on the action, by
tagging the aspect he’s introduced. The science of this declaration doesn’t
really need to be accurate to the real world – it just needs to sounds
scientific, and can even just be regular advice using long scientific words.
Since the bonus comes from tagging an aspect, the first one’s free, and
subsequent uses will cost a fate point.</p>

<p>The hand can certainly be quicker than the eye. This skill covers fine,
dexterous activities like stage magic, pickpocketing, and replacing an idol
with a bag of sand without tripping a trap. While Athletics is appropriate for
gross physical activities, most things requiring manual speed and precision
falls under this skill (that said, if you’re picking a lock, use Burglary).

<p>Picking a pocket is a quick contest between Sleight of Hand and the target’s

to the difficulty of this sort of work, the target usually receives a +2 bonus,
as if he were performing a full defense against the action. If the target is
distracted by something else, he loses the +2 bonus.  If anyone else is in a
position to observe the attempt, they also may make Alertness rolls to spot the

<p>When a character is hiding, he’s remaining perfectly still and (hopefully) out

is made from ambush, the target gets one last Alertness check to see if he

<p>This is the skill of outdoorsmen. It covers hunting, trapping, tracking,

<p>Survival also covers the breadth of interaction with animals, from training
them to communicating with them, albeit in a limited fashion. This includes
handling beasts of burden and carriage animals, as well as common pets.
Survival serves as a stand-in for all social skills when dealing with animals.

<p>Survival also covers the basics of riding. Characters looking to be
accomplished horsemen should consider the Equestrian stunt from Athletics (page

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id357" id="weapons" name="weapons">5.29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons</a></h2>
<p>(Stunts, page XX; Adjudication, page XX)</p>
<p>This is the skill for fighting with weapons, from swords to knives to axes to
clubs to whips. The exact weapon is more of a choice of style than anything
else, as this covers everything from fencing in European salons to sailors
using knives and batons on the docks.</p>
<p>The Weapons skill also covers the ability to throw small handheld weapons up to
one zone away, or to use weapons (like a whip) with unusually long reach to
attack adjacent zones, so a character would use this skill to be a good knife
fighter and knife thrower. This gives Weapons-focused characters a small leg up
on folks who fight with their Fists, with the downside that a Weapons user
needs to have a weapon in hand in order to make much use of the skill.</p>
<p>As a combat skill, Weapons inherently carries the ability to defend oneself in
a fight and as such, may be rolled for defense.  Weapons users are also
well-versed in a variety of fighting styles and weapons, and may use this skill
as a limited sort of knowledge skill covering those areas.</p>
<p>Characters with high Weapons include sailors, fencers, and some kinds of
athletes and circus performers.</p>
<p>If someone is devoted to using Weapons as a strong component of their fighting
style, it can safely be assumed that they possess the sufficient weaponry in
order to make use of the skill, regardless of Resources rating. This is, of
course, subject to the rigors of character concept and GM approval.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id358" id="id12" name="id12">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunts</a></h1>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id359" id="what-stunts-do" name="what-stunts-do">6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Stunts Do</a></h2>
<p>Stunts exist to provide guaranteed situational benefits, or special abilities
or minor powers, under particular circumstances.</p>
<p>A stunt may grant a character the ability to use a skill under unusual
circumstances, such as using it in a broader array of situations, substituting
it for another skill, or using it in a complementary fashion to another skill.
A stunt might allow a character to gain an effect roughly equal to two shifts,
when used in a specific way, or otherwise grant other small effects. Put more
simply, stunts allow the usual rules about skills to be broken – or at least
bent.</p>
<p>Some stunts may have prerequisites (other stunts or even aspects).
Particularly potent stunts may also require the use of a fate point in order to
activate. In general, a character should not take a stunt tied to a skill he
does not have at least at Average.</p>
<p>What follows is not a comprehensive list of stunts. GMs (and players under GM
supervision) are encouraged to create their own to fit their game. The
important thing to keep in mind is that entry level stunts – without
prerequisites – are the baseline; if the effect of the stunt is really unusual
or particularly potent, it may be somewhere down the line of a chain of stunts.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>The stunts in this chapter are presented skill by skill, and under each skill
they are further divided into thematic groups. Each group usually has one or
more “entry level” stunts – ones that don’t have prerequisites – and several
which require one or more of those entry level stunts to be taken first.</p>
<p>When building a character quickly, take a look at these groups – you may find
it easiest to simply take all the stunts within a group, as they are all
thematically similar, and can quickly establish what your character’s niche is.
As mentioned in Character Creation, characters start with five stunts. As
you’ll see later in the Tips and Tricks chapter, characters may be able to gain
additional stunts as the game progresses.</p>
<p>In order to help separate the stunts from the skill and category headings,
you’ll see a star symbol ✪ next to each stunt listed.</p>

from lost fantastic cultures (Atlantis, Erehwon, Lemuria), of extraterrestrial
or extradimensional origin, etc.</p>
<p>Your slots remain increased by the Linguist stunt, so someone with Average
Academics and these two stunts can speak every normal language on the

<p>&lt;quote&gt; The character’s prodigious reading has paid off in spades, and he is
able to recall minute details from even the most obscure literary works. The
character is always considered to have a library on hand of a quality equal to
his Academics skill, enabling him to answer questions with a base difficulty
less than or equal to his Academics skill, using nothing other than his brain
and some time for contemplation. Additionally, any research performed by this
character in a real library automatically takes one unit less time (see “Taking
Your Time” on page XX), and any libraries with a quality less than his
Academics skill do not limit the difficulty of the question asked, as they
normally would.</p>

<p>Requires Walking Library.</p>
<p>If you’ve read it, you remember it. If the answer lies in something you’ve read
before (this must be reasonable), then any research effort takes an additional
two units less time – stacked on top of the benefit of Walking Library, this
means that a half hour’s worth of research in books you’ve already encountered
can be resolved in a matter of seconds, and a day’s worth covered in a mere
hour. See the time table on page XX for more.</p>

<p>Your photographic memory extends outside of books. Once per scene, you may
spend a fate point and roll Academics against a difficulty of Mediocre.  Each
shift you generate may be used to specify a target that you wish to memorize as
you might a book – returning later, in your mind, to assess new details (using
an appropriate perception skill, usually Investigation).</p>
<p>This ability differs from Investigation’s Eye for Detail stunt in that Eye for
Detail covers the entire location, after the fact, whereas Studied Recall
requires you to specify which individual pieces of a location you are studying,
while you are still in that location.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Your character is a respected authority in a specific academic field.
Possibilities include history, English, archeology, mathematics and so on. In
the elite circles of that particular field, you are recognized for your
expertise. Even if your skill level is low, it merely means you are towards the
bottom of that particular group of the elite.</p>
<p>When you make an Academics roll pertaining to your general area of expertise,
you automatically receive a +1 bonus. Beyond this, you should pick a specific
specialization within that area (like ancient Sumerian history, or
cryptography). When an Academics roll involves that specialization, you gain an
additional +1 bonus (for a total +2 to the value of the research effort).</p>
<p>Any research efforts involving the specialization take one unit less time; this
may be combined with Walking Library, in the Memory group of stunts, for
lightning-fast research. When taking part in an academic conference or
otherwise interacting with others in the field, you may use Academics to
complement your social skills (Rapport, Empathy, Deceit, etc). Your skill is
considered elevated by these bonuses, so someone with Good Academics, acting in
his area of specialization, would complement skills as if his Academics were
Superb (Good+2).</p>
<p>This stunt may be taken more than once, each time for an additional field.  The
bonuses may not overlap, however.</p>

when you took the Scholar stunt) comes to bear, and you would use Academics to
modify Deceit, you may use your Academics skill instead of Deceit, gaining its
full value rather than a simple +1. If you’ve taken Scholar multiple times,
this stunt applies to all covered areas.</p>

<p>Your specialized knowledge gives you flashes of insight into all manner of

<p>Once per session, you can use this ability when you are about to perform an
action which your academic field touches upon. The connection can be tenuous,
provided you can explain to the GM how it might apply.</p>
<p>Make a declaration attempt as described under “Declaring Minor Details” (see
page XX). If you get at least one shift, you successfully declare one aspect;
for every two shifts you gain beyond the first, you may declare one additional
aspect about the subject in question (so two aspects total at 3 shifts, three
aspects total at 5 shifts, etc).  If you opt to declare only one aspect in
total, you may instead convert these additional shifts into non-aspect facts.</p>

<p>You may spend a fate point to go first in an exchange, regardless of your
initiative. If multiple people with this stunt exercise this ability, they go
in turn of their normal initiative, before those who don’t have the stunt get a
chance to act. If the exchange has already started, and you have not yet acted,
you may instead spend a fate point to act next, out of the usual turn order.</p>
<p>This may only be done between character’s actions, and cannot be done as an
interruption of any kind (so if you spend the fate point to do this while
someone else is acting, you must wait until they’re done). Your character must
not have acted yet in the exchange in order to use the ability in this way. If
your character’s turn has passed, and you elected to hold your action, then
there’s no need to activate this stunt; use the held action rules normally

<p>Requires I’m On Top Of It.</p>
<p>The character’s senses are so keyed into minute changes that he is able to
respond more quickly to new details. The character’s Alertness skill is
considered to be one higher for purposes of determining initiative (allowing
someone with Superb Alertness to have Fantastic initiative). This stunt breaks

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires On Top Of It.</p>
<p>The character’s always watching for his opponents to try to get something past
him, and can cut that option off, even when he fails in his primary effort
against them. Whenever your character attacks an opponent (or performing an
attack-like maneuver), then no matter how well the opponent rolls on his
defense, the opponent does not generate spin, and thus can’t provide a +1 in
his side’s favor (see page XX).</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires Ready for Anything.</p>
<p>Normally, a character who has held his action cannot interrupt another’s action
at all; he must allow the action to finish before acting. If your character has
this stunt, you may bend that rule.</p>
<p>Whenever you choose to hold your action, you may spend a fate point before
someone acts to have that person truthfully declare what he is about to do. You
may then use your held action to block (see page XX) the action your target has
declared, using whatever skill is appropriate to create the block. If you are
not opting to block the effort, you may not use your held action before your
target, and your target may proceed. If you commit to performing a block action
regardless of what your target declares, before he declares it, you do not need
to spend the fate point. Be clear about this when you make your demand!</p>
<p>Regardless, if you do act and your most recent target then changes his mind
based on that block, he must do so as a supplemental action (page XX), putting
him at a -1. If he continues his declared course of action despite what you
did, he must overcome the block.</p>

<p>The character maintains a quick and easy awareness of ambushes and other nasty
surprises – perhaps preternaturally, perhaps simply due to finely tuned mundane
senses. Whenever ambushed (see page XX), the character is able to take a full
defensive action, gaining a +2 on his defense roll, regardless of whether or
not he’s surprised (if he is surprised, dropping his base defense to Mediocre,
this stunt takes his base defense up to Fair).</p>

<p>Not only is the character never surprised, he is never forced onto a defensive

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires two other Alertness stunts.</p>
<p>The character has tuned his Alertness to the point where, if he takes a normal
Investigation length of time to open his senses to a location, he can gather an
Investigation level of detail about it, without really going through the
motions of a methodical search. When acting in this fashion, he may use
Alertness instead of Investigation (which, really, is nearly all of the cases
where he might use Investigation).</p>
<p>The trick with the results, here, is that they may come to the character with a
different set of details than a methodical approach would yield.  Conclusions
may precede supporting details; the GM might choose to describe the middle part
of a piece of information before the beginning or the end. Such are the hazards
of Alertness.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The artist is always examining the world for the creative hand at work.  Even
in endeavors which have nothing to do with art, he can recognize the elements
of personality – the “signature”, if you will – of those at work.</p>
<p>While this does not reveal identity, it does allow the artist to determine
common traits, themes, and behaviors with ease. Whenever making a determination
as to the source of something (its “author”, after a fashion), characters with
this stunt may use their Art instead of the usual skill that would be rolled.
If the character has encountered several products of the same person, he may
see past those things to the person – thus confirming a common source.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the character’s keen eye enables him to connect the metaphor of
the artist – his work – with the artist himself. When encountering a work of
art in any form, the character may roll Art to gain insight into the artist
behind the work, as if he were using the Empathy skill on the actual artist
(resisted by the usual skills). This stunt may only be used once per piece of
art.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this stunt allows the artist to make assessment efforts
against his target in absentia.</p>

<p>Whenever the artist uses his art to place an aspect on the scene, the aspect

<p>The artist has a way with words, and knows how to craft the most exquisite

<p>The artist’s skill at satire is so profound as to take the whole audience with

the audience (though it should be one familiar to the audience).  Normally,
aspects resulting from a performance may not be specific; with this stunt,
however, the player may specify the target in any aspect he puts on the scene.
Thus, while an artist might normally be able to add the “Hate” aspect to a
scene, but one with this stunt may make it “Hate Lord Octavian”.</p>

+2 on any “second roll” efforts made to corroborate information you’ve gotten
from another of your contacts. Consequently, this bonus is useful on a
follow-up, but not on the initial roll.</p>

<p>When selecting this stunt, the player picks a specific field (Criminal,
Business, Politics, Espionage and Occult are the most common); this stunt is
often written with that field incorporated, e.g., Big Man in Politics. The
character is not merely well connected in that community, he is actually a
person of great importance within that area; for maximum benefit, this should
be paired with an aspect that indicates similar things.</p>
<p>In addition to the narrative benefits of such a position, the character may use
his Contacting skill in lieu of the Resources skill for anything which might
fall under the auspices of members in that field. This stunt may be taken
multiple times, each time for a different field.</p>

<p>Deceit can be used to convince people you are someone you aren’t – but usually
only in a general sense. You can seem to be a cop, an author, et cetera, but
you can’t seem to be a specific person without a lot of work (and an elevated
difficulty). With this stunt, you can easily imitate the mannerisms and voice
of anyone you’ve had a chance to study – removing another potential cause to
have a disguise examined, or perhaps convincing someone who can’t see you that
you’re someone else even though you’re undisguised.</p>
<p>Studying someone usually requires only an investment of time, and not a roll of
the dice – at least half an hour of constant exposure. This timeframe can be
reduced, but will require an Empathy, Investigation, or Deceit roll against a
target of Mediocre, increased by one for each step faster on the time chart

<p>Requires Clever Disguise and Mimicry.</p>
<p>The character can convincingly pass himself off as nearly anyone with a little
time and preparation. To use this ability, the player pays a fate point and
temporarily stops playing. His character is presumed to have donned a disguise
and gone “off camera”. At any subsequent point during play the player may
choose any nameless, filler character (a villain’s minion, a bellboy in the
hotel, the cop who just pulled you over) in a scene and reveal that that
character is actually the PC in disguise!</p>
<p>The character may remain in this state for as long as the player chooses, but
if anyone is tipped off that he might be nearby, an investigator may spend a
fate point and roll Investigate against the disguised character’s Deceit.  If
the investigator wins, his player (which may be the GM) gets to decide which
filler character is actually the disguised PC (“Wait a minute – you’re the
Emerald Emancipator!”).</p>

<p>While the character is disguised (see Master of Disguise) he may make a single

<p>You inhabit your disguises so completely that you can actually fully inhabit
another persona and unlock hidden skills and knowledge you don’t normally
possess. While in a disguise, you may roll your Deceit minus two (so Fair if
Great, or Good if Superb) instead of any other skill the disguised persona
might reasonably possess. If you are outright imitating someone specific,
sometimes this might give you a higher effective skill than they actually have
– which is fine. You’re not a mind-reader, you’re simply so good at pretending
that you can actually, temporarily unlock a skill that you believe your persona
could have.</p>
<p>Any time you use this stunt, you must pay a fate point; if you do not wish
to pay a fate point, you may instead roll your Resolve against a difficulty
equal to the “false” skill. If you miss that target, you become lost in the
persona for a time, and may be subject to one no-fate-point compel before
you break out of it. The aspect compelled might not even be one of your
own – it may be one possessed by the persona you’re mimicking!</p>

<p>Your skill at reading people makes you adept at provoking a strong emotional
response if you’re trying to get them angry, depressed, or something similar.
Normally, the Intimidation skill would be used for such efforts; however, if
you’ve succeeded at any Empathy roll against the target previously, you may use
Empathy to wage such psychological warfare instead. In the hands of a character
with high Empathy, this is especially lethal when combined with a successful
read on someone that reveals an aspect.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires at least two other Empathy stunts.</p>
<p>Once you get an insight into someone, you may try to look much deeper than one
normally can. Trying to learn something specific and concrete about another
person can be a lot like trying to catch a specific raindrop – you can be sure
you got wet, but figuring out if you actually got the one you were going after
is another matter. In the best case scenario, you’ve revealed one of the
target’s aspects.</p>
<p>With this stunt, however, you achieve such a strong understanding of your
subject that you can start to make some fairly accurate guesses about his
behavior.</p>
<p>After you have successfully gotten a “read” as described in the Empathy
write-up (page XX), you may immediately ask the GM a hypothetical question
about the target’s motives, which the GM must be able to answer with yes, no,
or maybe, to the best of her ability. The question must speak to the kind of
person the target is, not things they’ve done, though it may ask if they are
capable of doing such things. If the GM answers with a maybe, you may ask a
second question to get clarification. This second question may seek details,
rather than another one-word answer.</p>

<p>The character may spend fate points to keep standing. Any time the character
would be taken out by (or otherwise suffer a consequence from) a physical hit
he may spend a fate point to remain standing or otherwise defer a consequence
or concession for one more exchange, or until he’s hit again, whatever comes
first. Once the extra time he’s bought is up, all effects he has deferred come
to bear at once. He may keep spending fate points in this fashion until he runs
out, each time the time limit expires.</p>
<p>This means that with a whole handful of fate points he might go on for three
exchanges with no consequences or collapse impeding him, and then suddenly keel
over, revealing Multiple Bruises and a Broken Rib and a few surplus
consequences – which would suggest an immediate taken out result to be
determined by his attacker, even if that attacker has been defeated in the
intervening time!</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Normally, someone who has not gotten a regular night’s sleep takes a
consequence indicating his lack of rest, which cannot be removed save with the
requisite amount of sleep. Not so for the character with this stunt.</p>
<p>Whenever this character would need to sleep, he may roll Endurance (see below
for the difficulties) and spend shifts to reduce the amount of time he needs
for a regular night’s rest. Each shift spent reduces the time increment (to get
a full night’s rest) by one. One shift gets from 6-8 hours down to 3-4; two
gets it down to an hour; three gets it to half an hour; four gets it to a few
minutes.</p>
<p>The character may continue sleeping past that point, but if awoken suddenly, he
does not face any issues due to insufficient sleep – he is refreshed and alert.
Normally the difficulty for the Endurance roll is simply Mediocre, but if the
character chooses to skip a night of sleep, the difficulty of the roll is
increased by one step each night. Once he fails the roll, he must get a full,
normal (6-8 hours) night of sleep to “reset” the clock; if he succeeds on
subsequent nights, and chooses to sleep, he can still sleep for the truncated
amount of time.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The character heals faster than the norm, which has the effect of reducing the
severity of consequences resulting from physical injury. On some characters
this means no matter how bad of a beating they seem to have taken, they shrug
it off. When considering the amount of time it takes to recover from a
consequence of a particular severity, reduce the timeframe by two steps on the
time chart (page XX). This means that mild physical consequences will be
removed between scenes even if there’s no “break” between them, moderate
consequences will take about an hour of rest instead of six, and severe
consequences may be reduced from months to weeks, weeks to days, or days to the
length of an afternoon!</p>

<p>If the character is ever taken out away from the view of other characters and
death appears imminent, certain, or absolute, (such as from dropping off a
cliff, apparently failing to escape from an exploding building and so on) then
coincidence will conspire to keep the character alive. This stunt does not
protect the character from dying “on camera”.</p>
<p>The player then spends half of his remaining fate points, rounded up (he must
have at least one to do this), and may watch play and think of a good
explanation for how he survived.</p>
<p>Once he has a story, he may re-enter play in any subsequent scene in as
dramatic a fashion as he sees fit, with all of his physical stress cleared and
a single consequence to reflect the dangers survived.</p>

<p>When the character takes a hit which would roll up, he may instead choose to
fill in any number of lower wound boxes that total the value of the hit.  Thus,
if the character took a 4 point hit, but the 4th box was already filled, he

<p>This character just doesn’t feel pain and can take more punishment than a

<p>The character’s physical injuries roll down rather than up. Whenever the
character takes a hit which would fill a box that has already been checked off,
they check off the next lower box that has not been checked off. If no lower

more than his capacity (difficult at best!) or all of his boxes are filled up.</p>

it starts working immediately, regardless of the difficulty rating to repair it
under time pressure. It will continue work for a number of exchanges equal to
the shifts gained on the Engineering roll (vs. a target of Mediocre). Once the
time is up, the device stops working again, and any efforts to repair it are at
a one step higher difficulty (since, after all, you hit the thing). If the

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires Gambling Man.</p>
<p>When it comes to head to head conflict, the character’s skill at gambling and
taking risks is paramount.</p>
<p>Once per scene, after the gambler has lost a Gambling roll, he has the option
to declare “Double or Nothing!” This is a call for both sides to reroll (and as
such doesn’t involve fate points). If the gambler wins the next roll, the
initial exchange is treated as a scratch (no loss to any participants), but if
he loses (by whatever amount) he takes a hit equal to double the value of the
initial loss. Regardless, such a move often elevates the stakes of a game.
This can turn a regular stakes game into a high stakes one, and a high stakes
game into a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>Normally, reloading your guns is considered a part of the normal ebb and flow
of combat and doesn’t become an issue until something happens to make it
relevant. A lack of ammunition can show up one of two ways.  First, “out of
ammunition” can often show up as a minor consequence for someone with a gun.
With this stunt, the character may spend a fate point in order to remove this
consequence immediately, at the end of any exchange.</p>
<p>The character is still considered to have taken a minor consequence for
purposes of determining whether his next consequence is moderate – the minor
consequence simply won’t be there.</p>
<p>Second, “out of ammunition” can show up as a temporary aspect resulting from a
maneuver (to try to get someone to use up his shots). Whenever this character
is the target of such a maneuver, he may defend at +2.</p>

<p>That last bullet has a kind of magic to it. A character with this stunt may

This is the character’s last shot – its use means that there’s no more ammo, no
holdout guns or the like. The only way the character is going to be able to use
his Guns skill in the scene is if he takes an action acquiring a new weapon or
ammunition, which may not always be possible. Even the Fast Reload stunt cannot

<p>Requires Steely Gaze.</p>
<p>Your character’s gaze is so terrifying that those faced with it can end up
paralyzed with fear. This stunt is used in the same fashion as Steely Gaze, but
if the opponent loses to the point of taking a consequence, he takes two
consequences, one right after the other, immediately. Even if this means he’s
taken out, the target retains the option to concede after recording the
consequence, thus keeping his right to define the nature of his defeat (subject
to the gazer’s approval).</p>

<p>Your character is a master of the terrifying, and can have an entire room

<p>Furthermore, minions (see page XX) whose quality level is beat by the roll fail
entirely and may not even roll to defend unless their leader discards his next
action for the exchange to roll Leadership to defend them. Without a capable
leader, these minions simply flee, faint, or otherwise take an immediate

<p>The character has a strong visual memory, and whenever he revisits a place

Investigation in a matter of seconds in order to determine what changed since
he was last there, as if it were an unusually detailed Alertness check.</p>

<p>Your character’s visual memory is so strong that with a little concentration,

<p>To use this ability, the character spends a fate point, and may make a single

that) to find things out as if he were still in the location, no matter how

<p>Sometimes your guesses play out to great advantage. Once per scene, you may
make a guess about what the “deal” is with a particular character, object,
location, or situation.</p>
<p>Do not speak this guess aloud; write it down on a piece of paper and give it to
the GM. The GM must accept it as a valid hunch that would be something of a
revelation if true (i.e., no “I’m convinced that moon orbits the Earth!” –
that’s too obvious). If, at some later point, your hunch proves to be correct,
you may use your Investigation or Empathy skill instead of any other skill,
where that target is concerned, for one exchange.  (A savvy GM will
occasionally alter her characters’ motives to match your hunches; if she does,
that’s absolutely perfect!)</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The character is skilled at concentrating on one of his senses to the exclusion

With a few moments of concentration, the character may enter a focused state.
So long as he remains in that state, for as long as the character uses nothing
but Investigation, all Investigation actions the character takes that use the
specified sense gain a +2 bonus. While in this state, if the character needs to
make a non-Investigation roll, that roll is at -2 due to this intense focus.</p>
<p>This stunt may be taken multiple times, each time for a single sense. If the
character has specified multiple senses, his focus may cover all of them at
once.</p>

<p>When paying attention, the character’s senses operate at a profound level of
focus, allowing him to pick up on details that, very simply, no one else easily
or even possibly could.</p>
<p>With this stunt, the character faces no increased difficulties due to a
physical detail being too small or subtle. As an example, this can reduce the
difficulty to detect the presence of nearly any poison to Mediocre (as,
honestly, subtlety is all it has to conceal itself ).</p>
<p>The use of this stunt may color what details a GM chooses to reveal to a
character as well, on a successful Investigation roll. Make sure to let the GM
know you have this stunt whenever rolling Investigation.</p>
<p>As this involves a use of Investigation, it must still be a deliberate
exploration, rather than a casual use better suited to Alertness.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Taking this stunt is an explicit indication that you are a member of some
manner of global conspiracy; it’s probably worth making sure you have an aspect
indicating as much. This stunt functions identically to the Network of Contacts
stunt for Contacting (see page XX), but in a fashion that is both more and less
powerful than that stunt.</p>
<p>Whenever you call upon a functionary or thrall of your conspiracy, creating a
companion on the fly, the companion is created with only one advance.  If,
instead, you’re looking to call upon one of the movers and shakers in the
conspiracy – not a peer, per se, but at least someone who’s significantly more
capable than a functionary – you may create the companion with one additional
advance, instead. This companion receives the Independent advance for free.</p>
<p>Doing so, however, means that your conspiracy now has one or two needs you must
fulfill – you immediately gain a temporary aspect related to these needs,
determined by the GM, and may not refuse compels of this temporary aspect
whenever it comes up. Occasionally this temporary aspect may instead reflect a
hidden agenda on the part of your momentary companion, rather than an explicit
“need”.</p>

<p>You may introduce an artifact that you design on-the-fly, in a fashion similar

<p>Because this is an artifact, however, a few differences exist. The artifact
gets three improvements, same as a Personal Artifact, instead of only two

taken multiple times and, unlike a Personal Artifact, may combine those
improvements into a single, more potent artifact.</p>
<p>There is, however, a downside…</p>
<p>All Rare Artifacts inevitably have origins shrouded in darkness and mystery. In
order to introduce such an artifact into play, the character must take on a
temporary aspect which vaguely, colorfully references the secret (and unknown)
past of the artifact. The GM may then incorporate its dark past into the
storyline, hitting the character with compels as appropriate.</p>
<p>If the player’s uninterested in having his impromptu artifact misbehaving on

<p>To use this ability, for each memory to be planted or removed, roll your
Mysteries skill. The result indicates the difficulty for someone to recognize
the memories as missing or false, as well as the difficulty – for the subject
or another mesmerist – to penetrate the shadow you have lain over their mind.</p>

<p>Requires Mind’s Shadow and Hypnotic Speech.</p>
<p>You are able to place even unwilling subjects into a hypnotic trance by using
Mysteries as an out-and-out attack.</p>
<p>This works best with a restrained subject, but so long as a target can hear the
sound of your voice, you have a chance to begin your workings upon him. Targets
who are not restrained or forced to be a captive audience defend with their
Resolve at +2, though a full defense action does not help them further.</p>
<p>You may approach this mental assault in one of two ways – either as a maneuver,
placing a temporary aspect that will only last the scene, or as an attack that
inflicts composure stress.</p>
<p>Maneuvers will be short-lived, but may be easier and more useful for immediate
effects. If you’re looking to lay on something more profound, you must attack
for stress instead.</p>
<p>If you inflict enough stress to indicate a consequence, concession, or taken
out result, the results must “play along” with the goals of your hypnotic
attack. Such results still can’t force a character to do something completely
contrary to his nature, but there should still be a lot of latitude in terms of
what sorts of compulsions you can place in the mind of your victim.</p>
<p>It’s easy to use this stunt improperly… and if you do, people are in the right
to label you as a villain.</p>

<p>The character is respected authority in a specific occult field. Possibilities
include ancient mythology, psychic phenomena, cryptozoology, and so on. In the
elite circles of that particular field, the character is recognized for his
expertise. Even if his skill level is low, it merely means he is towards the
bottom of that particular group of the elite.</p>
<p>This stunt is, essentially, the Mysteries parallel of the Scholar stunt, under
Academics (see page XX). When the character makes a Mysteries roll pertaining
to his general area of expertise, he automatically receives a +1 knowledge
bonus. Beyond this, the character should pick a specific area of specialization
within that area (like extraterrestrial demonology, or xenomorphic symbology –
the more syllables the better). When a Mysteries roll involves that
specialization, he gains an additional +1 bonus (for a total +2 to the value of
the research effort). Any research efforts involving the specialization take
one unit less time.</p>

<p>You are open to the strange and paranormal – though sometimes that means
letting in the Unpleasant Things from the Darkness and other such nuisances.</p>
<p>Normally, a character may be called upon by the GM to roll Mysteries as a kind
of paranormal Alertness skill, to pick up on the surface strangeness in a
place. With this stunt, you may deliberately use your Mysteries skill to gain
some mystic or terrible insight into the occult “climate” of an area, as if it
were Investigation – using a similar time-frame and gaining a similar level of
(paranormal) detail.</p>
<p>This also means that you may use Mysteries instead of Alertness when surprised,
if the origin of the surprise is in some way supernatural, and can even use
Mysteries as your initiative skill when locked in a conflict with otherworldly
forces.</p>
<p>Used with this stunt, Mysteries can give you access to information that would
normally be impossible to get – though the GM is under no obligation to give
you that information in any clear fashion. Muddled riddles and vague
intimations are the mode of the day.</p>
<p>There is an additional catch: Using this ability may open you up to an
unpleasant psychic attack by the presence or residue of Unnatural Creatures
that have touched the area … but at least you’ve learned something.</p>

<p>You have a companion with three advances (as described on page XX). This
companion is vulnerable to the flux of the spiritual aether, however, and must
be summoned into your presence – either pay a fate point to get his immediate
manifestation or take roughly a minute to roll Mysteries against a target equal
to the companion’s quality as a more gentle summoning.</p>
<p>This companion can never act in physical conflict, but may be visible to
others; this may limit what skills he can use with the Skilled advance. He
automatically gains the Independent advance as well. The companion will need to
take Skilled (Stealth) if he wishes to be undetectable on occasion; otherwise,
visible or not, his presence in a location is an immediate call for people to
roll Mysteries to notice something amiss.</p>
<p>If you take this stunt a second time (the maximum) you may provide another
three advances to your companion. If you have not yet increased the companion’s
quality to at least Fair, you must spend one of your advances to do so.</p>

cause a particular spirit to manifest.</p>
<p>Summoned spirits are not under any sort of compulsion to be cooperative, and
may have their own agendas, but once summoned, they may speak through the
character with others in attendance. At the GM’s option, especially if the
summoner gains spin on her Mysteries roll, the spirit may even manifest
visibly.</p>

<p>It’s not that you’re a good liar – possibly far from it. It’s more that you
have a skill at talking so fast, and not letting the other guy get a word in
edgewise, that he doesn’t ever get the chance to figure out if you’re lying or
not.</p>
<p>With this stunt, so long as you can keep talking, you can cover up increasingly
ludicrous lies. Start your fast-talk conversation with your target as a contest
between your Rapport and their Resolve or Rapport. If you win, the conversation
continues, and you repeat the roll on the next exchange.  If you fail, no
matter how poorly, you can spend a fate point to continue the conversation as
if you had won.</p>
<p>So long as you can keep talking uninterrupted and continue to spend fate points
to defer any failures, your endless blathering will prevent your target from
realizing quite what you’re doing. For the duration of the conversation, the
difficulty of any perception (usually Alertness) checks by the target are based
off your base Rapport skill, or your last successful roll, whichever value is
higher.</p>
<p>The target of this effort is by no means helpless – if they are attacked or
otherwise disturbed they may respond normally, and they will respond to obvious
stimuli (friends being attacked in their line of sight, fire alarms going off
and such). However, the target is definitely distracted. When using this
ability on multiple opponents at once, they each get to defend, and you take a
-1 penalty for each opponent past the first.</p>

<p>Rather than go looking for something, one can always just offer a reward.  The
character may spread some money around and use Resources in lieu of Contacting
to attempt to find somebody or something. He doesn’t literally need to offer a
reward, but it is necessary that he make an obvious display of wealth in some
venue or another, preferrably waving crisp money in the face of people in the
know (or people who know people in the know).  The downside of this approach is
that it tends to be highly public, at least within some circles, and anyone
interested will know what the character is looking for.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>One of your character’s properties – one location that functions as a Library,
Lab, Workshop, Arcane Library, or Arcane Workshop (see page XX) -- qualifies as
a full-blown private headquarters, such as a mansion or a secret cave. The
quality of this facility is automatically increased by two (such that it is
equal to your Resources skill or Resources+1 in the case of a specialized
function).</p>
<p>In addition, the headquarters may include one of the following extra elements:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Expert Staff.</dt>
<dd>Your headquarters has a small staff of competent individuals: two with
Average skill at something (choose the skill when defining the staff
member), and a head or lauded functionary with a peak skill of Fair.  These
are, within the bounds of your headquarters, companions whom you may call
on to assist you. They are bound to the location, and can’t ever leave it
without losing their companion qualities (they effectively drop to Mediocre
outside of their home environs). With another stunt, you may convert one of
these staff members into a Trusted Employee (see page XX).</dd>
<dt>Secondary Facility.</dt>
<dd>Your base facility normally serves one primary function – Library, Lab,
Workshop, Arcane Library, or Arcane Workshop. This extra allows you to
define a second function that operates at a quality level equal to your
Resources minus 3.</dd>
<dt>Extensive Security.</dt>
<dd>Security measures make your headquarters difficult to compromise. All
difficulties for bypassing your headquarters’ security are increased by
one.</dd>
<dt>Utmost Secrecy.</dt>
<dd>The location of your headquarters is tantamount to a state secret. Few know
of it, and even those located nearby may be unaware. The difficulty of any
Investigation or Contacting roll to find the location of your lair is equal
to your Resources.</dd>
<dt>Communications Center.</dt>
<dd>Your headquarters is the nerve center of a number of vital channels of
communication.  Any communications routed to, from, or through your base
take one time increment less to get to where they’re going, due to the
efficiencies offered.</dd>

<p>Requires Lair.</p>
<p>The character’s lair is very much a wonder of the world. Not only does
it have all of the possible elements listed above, but one of them may be
traded out for something unique and distinctive, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A world class lab (adding another 2 to the quality of one of the
facilities and speeding the rate of research by one increment).</li>
<li>An exotic location (just outside Atlantis, on the moon, etc .), including
a means of dedicated transport for reaching it.</li>
<li>A larger and highly competent staff (the facility head is of Good quality,
and there are two Fair and three Average staff members).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s even possible that this distinctive element is something weird, like
having your headquarters be mobile (movement is slow; the rate of movement will
never compete with a full-on vehicle or plane, and finding places to park is an
absolute pain).</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Your skill with Science gives you a distinct insight into certain kinds of
investigations. When appropriate, you may use your Science skill instead of
Investigation, particularly when the subject involves medical evidence.  If the

performing an autopsy) then the difficulty of the investigation drops by two

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The character has a singular ability to help the wounded recover from their
ills. Whenever rolling Science to provide first aid or proper medical attention
(see page XX), the roll is made at +2. A character with this stunt may choose
to have a medical degree, or at least certification to act as a paramedic,
nurse, or other medical professional.</p>

<p>Requires Doctor.</p>
<p>The character is talented at delivering medical care in the field. Normally,
someone providing first aid can remove a checkmark for every two shifts gained
on the roll (see page XX). With this stunt, every shift past the first one
improves the level of stress that may be removed (so three shifts will remove a
checkmark up to the three-stress mark, rather than the two-stress mark). If the
character rolls well enough to remove a stress mark that is higher than the
subject’s physical stress capacity (e.g., 6 or more shifts for a character who
has Mediocre Endurance), he may even remove a minor, physical consequence.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id670" id="surgeon-science" name="surgeon-science">✪ Surgeon [Science]</a></h4>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires Doctor.</p>
<p>You’re not only a doctor, you’re at the forefront of medical Science in action.
Your character is a respected authority in a specific field of surgical or
therapeutic medicine; define it at the time you take this stunt. Possibilities
include heart or brain surgery, transplant operations, disease pathologies, and
so on; your character has the opportunity to break new ground ahead of the
actual technological curve.</p>
<p>In the elite circles of the chosen field, the character is recognized for his
expertise. Even if his skill level is low, it merely means he is towards the
bottom of that particular elite group.</p>
<p>When the character makes a Science roll to perform surgery or other intensive
medical work, he acts at +1. In addition, when the roll involves his specific
area of specialization, he gets an additional +1 and may remove the difficulty
increase of any one factor affecting the operation (such as poor facilities, or
a lack of a particular supply, etc).</p>
<p>This stunt combines with the Doctor stunt for a large bonus – which is only
right, because practicing medicine is particularly hard, and patients are not
as understanding – or replaceable – as bunsen burners and test tubes. Those who
use Science to heal the human body are facing higher difficulties than they
might in other fields and, in game terms, they can use all the extra shifts on
those rolls that they can get.</p>
<p>Thus, surgeons start with the +2 bonus from Doctor, and add at least one, for a
total of +3. And better yet, they operate with a +4 in their area of utmost
expertise.</p>

bottom of his particular group of the elite.</p>
<p>Whenever the character makes a Science roll pertaining to his area of
expertise, he automatically receives a +1 knowledge bonus. In addition, the
character should pick a specific area of specialization (like gravity,
electricity or reptiles). When a science roll involves that specialization, his
knowledge bonus increases to +2, and any research efforts involving the
specialty are resolved at one time increment faster.</p>

that has bearing on the situation at hand (the player must play this out). Even
if it’s a crackpot theory, Science is a kind of new religion for this guy, and
his committed belief in his theory can translate into real effect.</p>
<p>Instead of using Science to make a declaration, the character may, for a fate
point, and only once per scene, use his Science skill to substitute for nearly
any other skill, subject to the GM’s approval. If the roll generates no shifts,
the scientist takes a minor consequence (such as “Crestfallen” or “Crackpot”)
to reflect the weight of his failure for the rest of the scene.  Otherwise,

impossible, unlikely, or simply too advanced for mankind’s present
capabilities. Unconventional construction methods, cars that run on brainpower,

<p>Your Mad Science must have a theme (such as Doktor Herborn's "metabolic
chemistry"), which you must define when you take this stunt. Any Mad Science
improvements you incorporate into devices must fit this theme (but with a
little creativity, most concepts can fit a sufficiently flexible theme).</p>

an engineer in order to help that engineer build mad sciences into his gadgets
for only a single improvement allocation.</p>
<p>Sadly, for most engineers (but perhaps happily for the rest of us!), mad

<p>You can prepare for a large illusion in a very short period of time, using

into play very quickly; the time it takes to prepare is reduced by three steps,
allowing the character to put together something in about a minute that would
normally take half an hour of preparation.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Your character suffers no environment-based difficulty increases when
using Stealth. This means that even when he’s out in the open and wouldn’t
normally be able to justify using Stealth, he may. This also means that,
once hidden, even people actively searching for him (page XX) do not get
a +2 to their Alertness or Investigation rolls.</p>
<p>This ability only functions so long as your character does not move, and
does not do anything other than hide. The moment he does something
else, he breaks cover and is immediately visible.</p>

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Requires In Plain Sight.</p>
<p>Your character is one with the shadows, and lives in every darkened corner,
unheard and unseen. You gain the full benefit of In Plain Sight, but may also
move one zone per exchange without automatically breaking stealth, allowing you
to remain hidden while moving, even when you shouldn’t be able to hide in the
first place.</p>
<p>If your character is in an environment that could give a bonus to stealth (like
one with a Dark or Smokey aspect) or even one that would normally justify the
use of Stealth to hide, you may pay a fate point to make a full sprint action
without automatically breaking stealth.</p>
<p>The upshot of this stunt is as follows: Whenever the character moves while
hidden, discovery penalties (see page XX) may still apply, but are cut in half.
Outside of conflict, this leaves observers at +1 for a cautious creep, +2 for
walking pace, +3 for a jog (short sprint) and +4 for an out-andout run (long
sprint); inside conflict, observers only get a +1 to detect the character for
every zone moved in an exchange. If used in combination with Like the Wind (see
page XX), these discovery bonuses are eliminated entirely.</p>

<p>A momentary distraction is all you need to vanish from the scene. Provided you

<p>Your talent with stealth may be extended to others who are with you close by,
provided that you travel as a group. As long as the whole group stays with you
and follows your hushed orders, you may make a single Stealth roll for the
whole group, using your skill alone. If someone breaks from the group, they
immediately lose this benefit, and may risk revealing the rest of you if they
don’t manage to pull off a little Stealth of their own.</p>
<p>You cannot apply the benefits of other stunts (besides Hush) to this roll,
though you may bring in your own aspects (and possibly tag the aspects of those
you are concealing) in order to improve the result.</p>
<p>The maximum number of additional people in the group is equal to the numeric

<p>It’s difficult to track you when you take care to walk lightly. Traps and such

<p>Whenever your character moves under cover of Stealth – the skulking trapping
for the skill (see page XX) – the bonus to discovery efforts is cut in half.
This means that out of conflict, observers are only at +1 for a slow creep, +2

observers are only at +1 per zone moved. If you combine this stunt with the

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Your character has cultivated a close companion from the animal kingdom.
This companion is designed using the companion rules (see page XX), with
a few changes and limitations.</p>
<p>Animal companions are designed using four advances. This companion operates
only with a “physical” scope, and must spend at least two of its advances on
“Skilled” or “Quality”. Any “Skilled” advances must be taken from a short list:
Athletics, Fists, Might, Stealth, and Survival. You may take only one skill
outside of that list, within reason, as based on the animal type. A raccoon
might have Sleight of Hand, representing its ability to perform fine
manipulation; a lion might have Intimidation (this is unsubtle, and not
considered a violation of the physical scope). If the animal is of an
appropriate size, this creature may be ridden as a mount, at +1 to Survival.</p>
<p>If the companion is a mount, such as a horse, or a more exotic beast that has
been persuaded to allow you to ride it, you may use that mount’s Athletics
skill instead of Survival in order to ride it. Athletics would also be used to
pour on the speed when the rider is too busy to “steer” the animal himself.</p>

<p>Pick a particular type of animal (cats, rodents, horses or the like). Your

they are likely to be favorably inclined towards him, granting a +2 when
interacting with the specified animal type.</p>

primates, cats, birds) and vermin (bugs, rats and other small scuttling
things).</p>
<p>There is loose overlap between these categories – pigeons are in all three –

<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>You’re skilled at breaking in new mounts. Normally, breaking in a mount is a
conflict between rider and steed. The rider is making social attacks (using
Survival vs. Resolve) on the animal while the animal is making Athletics or
Might vs. Survival physical attacks on the rider. When one party is finally
taken out, takes a consequence, or concedes, either the animal is broken or the
rider is thrown. Whatever the net result, the animal’s composure track clears
immediately.</p>

<p>Your character suffers no complications for an awkward or improvised weapon –

survive more than a few uses.</p>
<p>However, your character should never need to spend a fate point in order to
declare that an improvised weapon is close at hand, unless his surroundings
have been deliberately prepared against this (such as a prison cell). When

<p>You may only take this stunt if you have an aspect that refers to the

<p>You have a signature weapon, which has a name that is well-known among certain
circles, and a long and storied history surrounding its past owners.  The
weapon has a tendency to be always near at hand, even when circumstances have
conspired against it. If you’d normally have to spend a fate point to have this
weapon nearby, you can have it nearby without having to spend a fate point. If
you wouldn’t normally be able to get it near to you for a fate point, then this
stunt lets you spend a fate point even in the face of that impossibility. Once
the fate point is spent, the GM is not required to furnish your weapon
immediately, but must work to bend circumstances to make it available in
reasonably short order. Thus, you cannot be deprived of the weapon for long
unless you voluntarily give it up or pass it on to another.</p>
<p>Beyond the above capabilities, this weapon is an artifact (see page XX) that
includes the craftsmanship improvement, giving you a +1 whenever you are using
it. In addition, you may select one other improvement, including those only

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id734" id="vehicles" name="vehicles">7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles</a></h2>
<p>Vehicles have two main attributes, their top speed and their stress capacity.
This is noted simply as: Model T (car), Average, ❏ ❏ ❏ . This is a Model
T, and its vehicle type is a car (shocking). It has Average speed, and three
boxes of stress capacity (the amount of damage it can sustain before being
taken out).</p>
<p>The type of a vehicle is mostly relevant to understand the value of its speed –
the speed value is not absolute, but rather indicative of how fast the vehicle
is for the type of vehicle it is. The Model T’s average speed is much faster
than, say, a person’s average speed, but slower than the speed of an Gadgets
average plane. Speed comes into play for simple contests of which vehicle
is faster (roll speed vs. speed, modified by respective ride or drive skills
as appropriate) but for anything more complex, the chase rules (see page
XX) may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Vehicle technology has not advanced far enough yet that the car vastly
outstrips other means of transportation. This means that it’s entirely possible
that you may have a mixed group of vehicles, animals and people on foot and
need to keep a sense of how fast they are, relatively speaking. In a quick
sprint (which is more about acceleration than speed) no modifiers are
appropriate. In a short run, a person on foot is at -2 against a bike or horse
and -4 against a car, while the person on the bike or horse is at -2 against a
car. Over longer distance, skills hardly even matter – the faster base vehicle
wins.</p>
<p>One thing to remember about the vehicles of the era is that they came in a wide
variety of shapes and sizes. The 1922 Cadillac Suburban was designed to seat 7
people, so having a vehicle that can hold a whole group is entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>The prices for guns are pretty simple to figure out, but sometimes you want
to be able to drop the name of the shooting iron you’re carrying around.
By and large, different types of guns don’t have any game rules effect, but
when you’re picking a weapon to suit a character’s style, these distinctions
might come in handy.</p>
<p>There are just two game effects of “category”, here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pistols, most machine guns, and other handguns generally only have an
effective range of up to two zones, while rifles should be able to reach up
to three or four zones away easily.</li>
<li>The kind of gun someone carries will at the least limit the kind of
descriptions they can make about what they’re doing, based on the GM’s sense
of what’s feasible. This very simply means that, say, someone might be able
to talk more easily about laying down a spray of cover fire with a machine
gun in hand, than if they had a singleshot revolver. In terms of game rules,
this may have the strongest effect on what sorts of maneuvers the GM allows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The categories (with cost), follow, with a list of particular weapons in each
category.</p>
<p>Practical, “line of duty” Revolvers (Mediocre)
- Colt Detective
- Colt Police Positive
- Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10
- Webley Mk III</p>
<p>Hunting Rifles (Average)

<p>Explosives should be introduced carefully and meditatively into your game.
They can radically alter how a session will go. Make sure to read up on how
they operate (page XX) before considering any purchase or provisioning
of them in your game.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that most any explosive which you can readily throw or
use in combat is going to have an area of 1 zone. Larger explosives can be
acquired, but they are usually reserved for villainous schemes. Dynamites’s
cheap cost here is due to its wide availability, and is a bit of an anomaly.</p>

<p>Outside of the modern conveniences of death such as guns and bombs, it’s

<p>Engineers are capable of improving or customizing all manner of devices.  Of
course, they’re also capable of causing otherwise innocuous devices to explode
messily, so one needs to be careful. Rather than using the Resources skill to
buy items, they retreat into their workshops and use the tools and materials
they have there to invent and build those items using the Engineering skill.</p>
<p>Building something from scratch is based off a difficulty equal to the cost of
the item in question (see Spending Money, page XX). For example, building a
revolver from scratch is a Mediocre difficulty, due to the gun’s Mediocre cost.
It also requires appropriate tools, supplies and time. Tools and supplies are
measured by the quality of the engineer’s workshop, which must be at least as
high as the item quality (which is equal to the cost). To build a gun (Mediocre
cost and, thus, Mediocre item quality), the character must have a Mediocre or
better workshop.</p>
<p>Building something is time consuming, taking at least a day per level of item
quality over Mediocre (minimum of one day), so it’s assumed that characters
will only be building things that they can’t buy or acquire otherwise. More
often, it’s assumed they will skip the time to build the base item, and instead
start with something that already exists and then improve it.</p>

<p>Engineers can tinker to improve or change the workings of any device.
There is an array of possible improvements, which include:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Additional Capability</dt>
<dd>The device can now do something else of roughly the same scope. A car might
also be able to be a boat, for example, or a gun might be able to shoot a
grappling hook. Alternately, it may be able to do something normal but do
it exceptionally well (so that a technology works like it does in the
movies rather than real life).</dd>
<dt>Alternate Usage <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id52" id="id47" name="id47">[2]</a></dt>
<dd>The device allows skills to be used differently. For example, a ghost
detector might allow a Scientist to use Science rather than Mysteries for
the Sixth Sense effect.</dd>
<dt>Armed</dt>
<dd>Adds guns or blades to a device that would not normally have them, allowing
its use with the Guns or Weapons skill.</dd>
<dt>Armored</dt>
<dd>A device may be given a point of armor, meaning that any time it is hit for
one point of stress, the damage does not roll up even if that box is
already checked off (it does not prevent the stress, just the roll-up).</dd>
<dt>Futurization</dt>
<dd>The device can include a technological advance we already know about but
which hasn’t happened yet. However, this is limited to technologies that
existed before the beginning of World War II.</dd>
<dt>Speculative Science <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id52" id="id48" name="id48">[2]</a></dt>
<dd>This is like futurization, but extends to any technological effect which
could be achieved with technology from within the 20th century.</dd>
<dt>Unbelievable <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id53" id="id49" name="id49">[3]</a></dt>
<dd>Like futurization, but this allows for scientific advances which are
considered science fiction even today.</dd>
<dt>Independent</dt>
<dd>The device has some manner of autopilot and is able to act independently in
a very limited fashion.</dd>
<dt>Conscious <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id52" id="id50" name="id50">[2]</a></dt>
<dd>Like independent, but the device is capable of basic reasoning, and can
interpret simple commands.</dd>
<dt>Hair Trigger</dt>
<dd>This is mostly only applicable to explosives. A bomb with a hair trigger
has no delay – it blows up as soon as it’s thrown. The bad news is that
Hair Triggers can be a bit tricky, and there’s a chance of it blowing up in
your hand.  Failing the throw means that it explodes at the thrower’s feet!
Also, if a character carrying a hair trigger device takes any physical
stress or consequences, he must roll a die, and on a -, it explodes.</dd>
<dt>Miniaturization</dt>
<dd>Something that’s not normally portable can now fit in a large set of
luggage, while something merely large can now fit in a wristwatch.</dd>
<dt>Maximization</dt>
<dd>The inverse of miniaturization: Sometimes you just need something to be
BIG! This improvement is used to alter an item for circumstances when size
will truly matter, such as a weapon that can’t possibly damage its intended
mega-monster target without being very large, or a car that’s actually
house-sized and able to transport a huge number of passengers.</dd>
<dt>Craftsmanship</dt>
<dd>The device gives a +1 bonus to any effort using it (usually only to one
skill, if the device supports the use of multiple skills). This improvement
may not be taken more than once per affected skill.</dd>
<dt>Rugged</dt>
<dd>The device has 2 extra boxes of stress capacity over the default, which is
usually 3. May be taken multiple times.</dd>
<dt>Special Effect <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id52" id="id51" name="id51">[2]</a></dt>
<dd>A device may now operate on different principles, like a car that runs on
water or a gun which can shoot ghosts. The game benefit of this will depend
highly on the specifics.</dd>
<dt>Upgrade</dt>
<dd>A specific improvement, granting a +2 bonus to some fairly specific use for
the thing. A car, for example, might get a +2 in a swamp or a +2 on the
straightaway.</dd>

<p>To improve an item (rather than create it from scratch), start with the base
difficulty to create the device based on the item quality, as before.</p>
<p>Next, determine how many improvements you want to make. Each improvement
increases the difficulty (and required workshop quality) by one. Each
improvement takes approximately 8 hours to implement.</p>
<p>If the player is willing to increase total time to improve the item by one
increment on the time table (page XX), he gains a +1 bonus to the roll;
increasing it again results in a +2 bonus, and so forth. This bonus doesn’t
reduce the requirements for the workshop, however; that’s still based on
the quality of the item (and thus the difficulty target). The player may also
reduce the time spent; if less total time is spent improving the item, each
step faster on the time table imposes a -1 penalty to the roll.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Equipment that characters make can be expected to last for the duration of a
single adventure, but is assumed to be lost, deconstructed or otherwise removed
from play between adventures. Failure on the roll is subject to the rules for
“taking your time” (page XX) in order to retroactively succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id741" id="personal-things" name="personal-things">7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Things</a></h2>
<p>Characters are able to buy <strong>personal gadgets</strong> as stunts (see page XX).
Gadgets bought this way generally start from a baseline item of any sort, with
three improvements applied. Cost factors are set aside since the gadget is
getting “paid for” in terms of stunts.  Alternately, the player can take
multiple devices and spread those three improvements among them.  The GM and
player may work together to create new improvements that fit the concept of the
gadget.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Personal gadgets can be taken away, destroyed or lost over the course of an
adventure unless the character also has an aspect for the gadget. However, the
GM should assume that the character recovers or replaces the device between
adventures. If the character has an aspect for the gadget, the GM may, at his
discretion, allow the player to invoke the gadget’s aspect to make a
declaration that he’s recovered the device fortuitously during the course of
play. Gadgets that are tied to aspects in this way become central to the
character’s story and, as such, should never be taken away from the character
for too long.</p>
<p>Personal gadgets can use improvements which require weird science. If the
player does not have the Weird Science stunt, he must apply “Uses Weird
Science” (at the cost of one improvement) before applying the weird
improvements themselves (so a device may have two weird improvements for a
total cost of three improvements).</p>
<p>Personal gadgets can also use improvements which require mad science, subject
to much stronger GM scrutiny. If the player does not have the Mad Science
stunt, he must apply “Uses Mad Science” (at the cost of two improvements)
before applying mad science improvements.</p>

<p>Characters can also take unspecified gadgets as stunts. This is useful for
characters who are likely to carry around a variety of gadgets and need to pull
out just the right thing for the occasion. These sorts of gadgets are called
universal gadgets (page XX).</p>
<p>When a character begins an adventure, his gadget doesn’t need to be defined.
Instead, at the point where he decides he needs it, he reveals the device,
which can have two improvements. If a character has multiple stunts, they can
combine them to make one gadget with many improvements. Once the character has
declared the gadget, he has it for the rest of the adventure.</p>
<p>If the character wishes to introduce something a little more dramatic, he may
instead introduce a wonderful toy.</p>

<p>Sometimes a gadget is a “fast forward” button that, when used, effectively
allows the characters to skip to the end of a scene, perhaps by being exactly
the right thing to get past a lock, or releasing gas at just the right time to
incapacitate the guards.</p>
<p>Instead of pulling out a device with improvements, an unspecified gadget can be
used for a specific effect, which is usually enough to simply bypass any
challenge, or at least radically redefine it. This is a one-shot effect,
trading off a more potent effect for being able to use it only once. These
effects are always subject to GM veto.</p>

<p>While the prices for normal items can be found elsewhere (see page XX),
sometimes a particularly rich individual is interested in purchasing something
a little bit more custom for himself. Buying an item with upgrades requires two
things: finding someone willing to sell, and shelling out the cash.</p>
<p>The difficulty for finding a seller is a Contacting contest with a difficulty
equal to the difficulty of improving the item. This will take one day, +1 day
per upgrade. Shifts generated on the Contacting roll may be spent to reduce the
timeframe as usual (four shifts make it just half an hour).</p>
<p>Once a seller has been found, the base price of the item is equal to the cost
of the base item, +2 per upgrade.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Upgraded devices which are purchased have the same limitations as those
built in the workshop, which is to say that they do not last between adventures.</p>

<p><strong>Artifacts</strong> are devices that work on different principals than traditional
science. Artifacts use many of the same rules as gadgets, but with a few
exceptions. Visually, artifacts are rarely subtle – they are covered in arcane
runes and mystical carvings, and their use is definitely likely to raise
eyebrows.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id747" id="making-and-improving-artifacts" name="making-and-improving-artifacts">Making and Improving Artifacts</a></h4>
<p>The base quality of an artifact is at least Good, reflecting the strange and
curious materials such things must be made from. An artifact may be upgraded
with many of the same upgrades as gadgets, excepting <em>futurization</em> or <em>hair
trigger</em>.</p>
<p>That said, there are a small number of upgrades that are only available for
artifacts:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Arcane</dt>
<dd>This does not actually do anything, except it makes whatever else the
artifact does into a magical effect. There are situations where this will
be quite useful, such as when the GM throws in some zombies who can’t be
permanently killed without magic.</dd>
<dt>Blessed</dt>
<dd>The GM should consider what restrictions he puts on this – an artificer
should also be a holy man of some sort, like a priest. This is very much
like the Arcane modifier, except the things that respond to it may be a
little different.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An artifact can use effects that would normally require Weird Science without
an appropriate stunt, but it means that there is a potential complication. It
may mean that Elder Things are tied into it, or it may have bizarre side
effects. For example, the artifact version of “conscious” might mean the
artifact has a quirky personality, or it might have the potential to become
truly self aware and a danger to all those around it.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id748" id="personal-artifacts-and-rare-artifacts" name="personal-artifacts-and-rare-artifacts">Personal Artifacts and Rare Artifacts</a></h4>
<p>Personal artifacts (page XX) function pretty much the same way as personal
gadgets, and effectively use the same rules. However, artifacts can use weird
science or mad science improvements without an appropriate stunt (and without
the additional cost that’s applied to gadgets), but such effects are subject to
complications (see above).</p>
<p>Multiple personal artifact stunts can’t be combined into the same artifact –
for that, you need a rare artifact. Rare artifacts work like universal gadgets,
in that they can be defined on the fly, but they have three improvements
instead of two and a guarantee that they fall under the “potential
complication” effect from above. This is reinforced by the idea that, when the
character reveals a rare artifact, he may take a temporary aspect to represent
the complication (see the Rare Artifact stunt on page XX for more).</p>

<p>In this chapter, we’ll take a look under the hood, and see how to make use of
skills from the GM’s end of things. We’ll also talk about general principles
for setting difficulties and other common situations as a GM.  Overall, the
focus here is to provide the GM with extensive (perhaps, at times, too
extensive!) guidance on how to make the dice-rolling stuff really work. Where
needed, with each skill we cover, we look at each trapping (see page XX) in
depth. We’ll also look at other special uses for skills (which is why we put a
section on poisons under the Endurance section, for example).</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll pull the camera back a bit from this tight focus,
and look at overall strategies for GMing from an adventure design perspective.
But for now, onward, to the nuts and bolts…</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id750" id="setting-difficulties" name="setting-difficulties">8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Difficulties</a></h2>
<p>Before you – the GM – call for a die roll, it
is critically important that you stop and do
two things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Imagine Success</li>
<li>Imagine Failure</li>
</ol>
<p>It sounds simple, but it can make a critical difference. Success is usually the
easy part, but failure can be bit trickier. You want to make sure that both
outcomes are interesting , though interesting certainly doesn’t need to mean
good.</p>
<p>If you cannot come up with a way to handle either outcome, you need to rethink
the situation.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that, because there are few things more frustrating to a
player than making a skill roll and getting told that it nets them no new
knowledge, no suggested course of action, no new development for the story, and
so on.</p>
<p>So, whenever you call for a roll, be absolutely certain you understand
entails. If one or the other branch does not suggest a course of action,
then calling for a roll is probably a bad idea.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Now, that said, every roll does not need to have high stakes. There should
always be a consequence to failure, but there are degrees of consequence,
and minor setbacks may be overcome for a larger success. If there is a large
issue on the table, try not to have it hinge entirely on one roll – spread it
out across the scene. Just as a roll has consequences, so does a scene, and
the scene should have meaningful consequences.</p>
<p>The whole point of the consequences is to keep players engaged. It makes rolls
into something a little more meaningful than hoping to get lucky on a die roll.
That fact is the ultimate informer on how you want to set difficulties. The
goal is to make any roll satisfying.</p>
<p>With that in mind, as a general guideline, difficulties should be set low (with
a few exceptions we’ll cover in this chapter). If you leave difficulties at the
default of Mediocre (+0) then characters will almost always succeed, but there
is still a chance for failure. What this means is that characters will rarely
fail, but failure is still a possibility in most circumstances. You can
increase difficulties from that, but always stop and think about why you want
to do that. The answer should always be “because you want failure to be more
likely” – hopefully because failure’s cool too.</p>
<p>If you are tempted to make a roll so difficult that failure is likely, make
sure you’ve got a solid reason why that’s so, and why you’re calling for a
roll.</p>
<p>With difficulties set low, shifts (page XX) become critically important.  When
the question is not “will they succeed?” then it becomes “how (or how much)
will they succeed?”, and that means the number of shifts a character generates
on a roll becomes the yardstick you can use to frame how something turns out.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that every roll should be fun, whether it succeeds

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id751" id="id55" name="id55">8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin</a></h3>
<p>In the interests of repeating ourselves: In its broadest sense, spin is a
special effect that occurs whenever a character scores a significant or better
success (3 shifts or more). That special effect may simply be color – it may
mean the character looked particularly cool, or is due some recognition for
excellence. In some cases, as outlined in skills and elsewhere, gaining spin
can result in an actual game effect. In combat, if a character gets spin on a
defensive, he can add a +1 to the very next action that occurs (even if it’s
not his own). Other applications of spin, found throughout the text, will exist
as well, but in general, it serves as an easy way of making note that a
character has done particularly well on a roll. Whenever characters roll well
enough to generate spin, it’s time to sit up, pay attention, and spice up the
details. See page XX for deeper details on the concept of spin.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id752" id="setting-declaration-difficulties" name="setting-declaration-difficulties">8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Declaration Difficulties</a></h3>
<p>Some skills (such as knowledge skills like Academics) may allow a player to
make declarations. A declaration is typically a player-driven assertion that
there is a particular aspect (determined by the player) on a particular target
(an individual character, group, location, scene, or story). Broadly,
declarations allow players to introduce facts into the setting and storyline.
The difficulties for declarations should, honestly, be based on how interesting
the proposed fact or aspect is. Ideas which would disrupt the game or are just
unreasonable should simply be vetoed. These are the questions to ask yourself
when determining difficulty:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Is the declaration interesting (or funny)?</li>
<li>Will the declaration have interesting consequences if it’s acted
upon but is wrong?</li>
<li>Does the declaration propose a specific and interesting or heroic
course of action?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each “no” adds 2 to the base difficulty of Mediocre. If the proposed fact is
very amusing, proposes an interesting course of action and has interesting
consequences if wrong (three “yes”-es), a Mediocre difficulty is appropriate.
By contrast, a boring fact with a dull course of action and no possible
consequences has a difficulty of Fantastic.</p>
<p>If your players haven’t quite got a grasp of how much they can do with
declarations, you will probably need to lower the difficulties to suit – but
you should let them know what makes a declaration more likely to succeed.</p>

<p>Several skills (perception skills especially) may be used to make assessments.
An assessment is an effort made by a character to discover one or more hidden
aspects about a particular target (an individual, group, location, or scene).
If the target of an assessment is a person or a group, the difficulty of the
assessment is usually an opposed skill roll. Static entities like locations or
objects typically have difficulties based on their quality. If there’s no
obvious way to determine the assessment difficulty, consider the baseline
difficulty to be Mediocre.</p>

<colgroup>
<col width="20%">

</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">

group.</td>

</table>
<p>At the GM’s discretion, if a character gains spin (page XX) on an assessment
roll, he may gain insight into a more potent fact, or one additional fact –
potentially allowing good rolls to result in the revelation of two aspects.</p>

<p>When a character takes an action, it is expected to take a certain amount of
time, ranging from a few moments to a few days. Sometimes characters need to

happens, take a look at the chart on page XX and find how long the tasks should

<p>When a character fails a roll to perform a task that he reasonably should be
able to do, the GM can simply rule that the task succeeds but takes longer than

<p>(Skill, page XX, Stunts, page XX)</p>
<p>When setting the difficulty for a research roll, the best yardstick is the
obscurity of the knowledge sought.</p>
<p>Something with a Fantastic difficulty is probably only known by one or two
people in the world. Superb difficulty is limited to the handful of leading
experts. Great would equate to all the top men in the field, while Good and
lower start getting into the common body of knowledge. Difficulties beyond
Fantastic are appropriate for lost knowledge. Shifts on the roll should
correspond to the depth of detail discovered.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id759" id="id58" name="id58">8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alertness</a></h3>
<p>(Skill, page XX, Stunts, page XX)</p>
<p>For surprises and the like, Alertness rolls are usually contests, so
difficulties are easy to determine.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Alertness rolls should generally have a very low difficulty, for
several reasons. Most notably, if you have included something like a clue for
someone to stumble across, you probably want it to be found.</p>
<p>Additionally, nothing makes players more paranoid than a call for an Alertness
check from out of blue. For even the best groups, it can increase tension as
they wonder what it is they missed. Therefore, such general calls for Alertness
rolls should be used sparingly, and should only be used when you actually have
something to tell people… even if they don’t end up rolling well enough to
discover it.</p>
<p>Consequently, if difficulties are set low, then characters will always see
<strong>something</strong> – the trick is to make sure the outcomes are tiered, so that you
have more information to give to the person who does well, but you still have
something for the person who does poorly.</p>
<p>When you have multiple characters performing Alertness checks, provide the
information to the person who did best first, then for each person down the
line, tell them what they don’t see. Doing it in this order lets the players
get a clear picture, while making the limits of their characters’ knowledge
very clear.</p>
<p>If you want to simulate a confusing situation, one where it’s difficult to see
clearly what to do because of smoke, mirrors or simply too much activity, it’s
reasonable to say all actions will be restricted by Alertness (see page XX),
imposing a -1 on all of a character’s skills rated higher than his Alertness.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id762" id="id61" name="id61">◉ Art as Craft [Art]</a></h4>
<p>Art can normally be used to create something with no real problem, especially
if the character is a virtuoso. The dice only need to come out when the
character is trying to get a specific effect. The conflict rules can cover most
of those situations, but in a pinch, the character may use Art in contest to an
opponent’s perception skill, as in forgery (see page XX).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id763" id="id62" name="id62">◉ Art as Performance [Art]</a></h4>
<p>When Art is used to put aspects on a scene, those aspects describe the mood of
the scene, and as the GM, you should keep them in mind for more than just
invocations and compels. For instance, if the mood of a scene is “somber” then
you should take that as a cue for NPC behaviors, just like you’d describe a
scene with a “dark” aspect as having things that are hard to see..</p>
<p>It’s also worth remembering that the mood of a group offers a secondary
opportunity for compels and other complications – if the mood of the room is
somber, and a player fails to act in accordance with the mood, others will
probably respond badly to them, rather the way people might respond to someone
using their cell phone in a funeral.</p>
<p>Not every performance is going to put an aspect on a scene. To start out, the
artist describes what aspect he’s trying to put on the scene and how he’s going
to go about it. The difficulty for an adequate performance is Mediocre, but the
difficulty for a performance that’s good enough to shape the mood is starts two
higher, at Fair. This difficulty may be further modified by other factors:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="22%">
<col width="70%">
<col width="8%">
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">

<th class="head">Mod.</th>

</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>Adding to a

<td>If the room has an existing mood, adding an
additional mood is a little harder.</td>
<td>+1</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Changing a
mood</td>
<td>If the new mood is going to replace an existing
mood (either by design, or because it’s actively
contradictory to the existing mood), it’s more
difficult.</td>
<td>+3</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Distractions</td>
<td>A noisy room or other activities will make it

attention to the performance, such as on a

</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, the baseline difficulty is Mediocre, and as long as the character beats
that, the performance is technically adequate. The modifiers are applied to the
performance that has an emotionally transportive quality. Essentially, the
second difficulty indicates the number of shifts over Mediocre the artist needs
to get in order to place an aspect on the room – starting with two shifts for a
distraction-free, no-existing-mood-to-address performance.</p>

<p>If the performance targets an individual, the base difficulty of the effort is
the Contacting skill of the target being satirized. The target’s Contacting
skill is used to approximate the character’s reputation and ability to mitigate
the satire’s impact. Treat this as an attack or maneuver as appropriate to the
situation.</p>

<p>When we say “performance,” it mostly means an active artistic endeavor, such as
a play or musical performance. In those situations, the skill roll is made at
the time of the performance. Occasionally a more static art form, such as
painting, can be used to impact a mood, but it requires an active display of
the artist’s work, such as at an art show or a dramatic reveal at an estate’s
ball. Here, the revelation and discovery of the art piece is where its maximum
impact occurs, and in game terms, that’s where the effort is focused.</p>

<p>Performances are a powerful way to set up a scene with an advantage for the
artist (or his sponsor). Using an artist’s performance to lay down some scene
aspects can be very powerful if a character is planning to play on those
aspects in the subsequent scenes. Players who have invested in a high Art skill
will expect to be able to do this on a semi-regular basis, and as a GM you
should be ready for them to do so, and to succeed.</p>

<p>Difficulties for forgery should be set at Mediocre for something simple like a
letter or a ditty, Good for something more involved like a painting or a novel,
and Superb for something that will be challenging in its own right, like a
symphony. Subtract 1 from the difficulty if there is an original on hand to
work from. An appropriate Investigation or Art use would be used to oppose or
otherwise detect the forgery.</p>

<p>(Skills page XX; Stunts page XX)</p>
<p>Because Athletics can be used for so many different physical activities, the GM
needs to be especially aware of when she should and should not call for a roll.
It’s very easy to think “That’s a wall; I should call for an Athletics roll to
see if they can climb it,” forgetting that this is a bad idea unless you’ve got
a good idea of how failure is going to be interesting. No skill should ever be
rolled purely for its own sake, and Athletics is often in danger of being used
without meaningful story impact.</p>
<p>Athletics can be used offensively in combat, but in strongly limited ways.
Athletics should never be used to inflict stress, but it is often a reasonable
skill for certain maneuvers. If the maneuver involves pushing around heavy
things, Might (or Might modified by Athletics) will be more appropriate, but if
it’s more about grace than power, Athletics is certainly a better match.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id769" id="id65" name="id65">◉ Jumping [Athletics]</a></h4>
<p>Jumping is, oddly, one of the most difficult things to adjudicate. Consider the
classic situation of characters looking to jump over a bottomless pit – as GM,
you want the scene to have some tension, but you don’t want anyone falling to
their death because of dumb luck. Aspects and fate points can mitigate this to
some extent, but this means you do not want to set the difficulty too high.
Consider the difficulty you set to be the point where they barely make the jump
and improve it by shifts. If you set the difficulty higher, but treat a failure
as “barely making it” then your players will catch on, and the thrill will be
gone. If, instead, you make the threat of failure smaller but more real,
players will respond more strongly, and feel strong incentive to use aspects
and fate points.</p>
<p>When not looking to introduce the chance of failure, simply avoid calling for a
roll to clear the pit, and instead give it a high “border” value to increase
the cost of crossing from one zone (the near side of the pit) to another (the
far). Another softer approach is letting a failure be a realization that the
character just isn’t up to the task – “You missed the roll by two? Well, it’s
clear to you that it’s too far. You’ll have to find another way around, or get
someone to throw you a rope.”</p>
<p>That said, if it’s only an apparently bottomless pit, and something interesting
(rather than something lethal) happens to people who fail… let the dice roll!</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id770" id="id66" name="id66">◉ Climbing [Athletics]</a></h4>
<p>Climbing is not quite as bad as jumping, but it can be quite boring. Unless
you’ve got a really good reason why climbing needs a roll, just assume people
get over the obstacle. If, however, the wall is virtually impossible to climb,
that gives a character with appropriate stunts an opportunity to shine –
absolutely a good time to call for a roll. Climbing difficulties are determined
on two axes – first the base difficulty is determined by height.  Climbs, like
falls, are either Short, Medium, Long or Extreme, and they follow the same
rules for height that falls do (see below, page XX).</p>

<p>These difficulties assume a fairly easy climb, a situation with many hand and
footholds, like a fence. They are subsequently modified by circumstance. The
three main factors affecting a claim are slipperiness, visibility and
distractions. Each of these can increase the difficulty by 1 or 2.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Given all these difficulties, certain climbs (like a glass skycraper at night,
while someone’s shooting at you) are going to be too difficult even to try, so
it’s important for a climber to know his limits (or have stunts to exceed
them).</p>
<p>Most of the time, you won’t need to get into the nitty-gritty of a climb, since
most climbs are either fairly simple (in which case, definitely consider why
you’re asking for a roll) or are of the “Impossible! No man could do such a
thing!” variety. If you’ve got a character who has taken stunts to allow such
climbing, remember to hook him in with opportunities to show his stuff.</p>
<p>Climbing should usually be binary – if the character can’t do it, they usually
figure that out near the bottom, so they succeed or they don’t, rather than
getting partway up, slipping, and falling. However, if you want to insert such
a moment of tension, halfway up a wall is an excellent time to compel an aspect
(environmental ones are good for this) and, if the player accepts, demand a new
roll.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id771" id="id70" name="id70">◉ Falling [Athletics]</a></h4>
<p>A short fall is usually anything under 20 feet. It can hurt, but in heroic
fiction, such falls are little more than inconveniences. A medium fall is more
substantial, anything up to three or four stories. If the fall is more than
that, but you can still see details on the ground (say, 10 stories), it’s a
long fall. Anything more than that is an extreme fall. By default, a short fall
imposes minor consequence, a medium fall imposes moderate consequences, a long
fall imposes severe consequences, and an extreme fall hops right to taken out
regardless of die rolls (unless stunts get involved). See the table below for a
summary of these effects.</p>
<p>When a character falls, he should roll Athletics. If he fails to make a
Mediocre (+0) difficulty, the fall is treated as one category worse than it is.
If he beats a difficulty based on the length of the fall (as shown in the table
below), he may treat the fall as one step shorter (so a long fall would be come
a medium fall and so on).</p>
<p>Extreme Falls (and falls in general) are more useful as a threat than a
reality.  The danger of a fight on top of a skyscraper is emphasized by the
danger of falling, but the falling should never be central to the scene, unless
you can think of a way to make it very cool.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id773" id="id72" name="id72">◉ Casing [Burglary]</a></h4>
<p>Casing can be treated as either an assessment or a declaration. Players may
respond well to feeling that they have some ownership of the scene, so in
general, if a player’s willing to step up and declare something about the
joint he’s casing, you should not only let him, you should encourage it. If
the player declares, see the “Setting Difficulties for Declarations” section,
page XX, for guidelines about setting difficulties for casing.</p>
<p>There’s no guarantee that a player will do that, however. Sometimes you’ll
instead approach this as assessment – the player wants you to reveal an aspect
to him if he rolls well enough. This is also fine, but the guidelines for
difficulty are less responsive to the “interesting”-ness of the aspect to be
revealed – you’re the one coming up with it, after all, rather than the player.
Since this will almost always give rise to a scene aspect that will be broadly
available and have a significant impact on the shape of the coming scene, you
should be looking for the character to score several shifts above a standard
difficulty of Mediocre – so, all other things being equal, rolls of Good or
better will reveal findable flaws, unless a strong effort has been made to
conceal those flaws.</p>
<p>Both of these circumstances really only address a static target, where there is
no strong, driving force behind the security effort. If a significant NPC is
taking an active role in, say, patrolling or monitoring security at a location,
the location has suddenly become much more difficult to burgle.</p>
<p>When this is the case, the casing effort may instead turn into Burglary (on the
PC’s part) vs. Burglary or Investigation (on the NPC’s part) rolls – and the
NPC may already be aware of the aspect knowledge he wants to keep out of the
PC’s hands. If this is the case, such contests may function an awful lot like
someone trying to “read” another person, as with Empathy, only it’s a building
or other location here rather than a person. For an idea of how to handle such
cat-and-mouse aspect revelations, see the sections on Empathy, Rapport, and
Deceit both in Skills chapter and this one (page XX, page XX, page XX, page XX,
page XX, and page XX).</p>

<p>Burglary will frequently see use in overcoming locks and other security
measures. Most locks that a person runs into on a day to day basis are of
only Mediocre difficulty, but more specialized locks are more difficult. As
a rough guideline:</p>
<blockquote>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="field-name">
<col class="field-body">
</colgroup><tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Front Door, Simple Padlock:</th><td class="field-body">Mediocre</td>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Bank Vault:</th><td class="field-body">Fantastic</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Most locks require some sort of tools to open. For regular locks, this is some
sort of pick, whereas safes and vaults require more specialized tools. These
difficulties all assume investing a few minutes, if not longer, depending on
the lock. If the character wishes to take less time, he must get additional
shifts and adjust the timeframe according to the time table (page XX). If he
lacks the proper tools, the difficulty is boosted by 2 at minimum. He must have
some kind of tools to use, however; the job can’t be done otherwise unless it’s
a very unusual lock indeed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id775" id="o-security-burglary" name="o-security-burglary">◉ Security [Burglary]</a></h4>
<p>Security systems as a whole are just collections of smaller elements, like
window locks, tripwires, alarm bells and so on. The quality of a security
system (which determines its difficulty to assess or overcome) depends
upon who was responsible for setting it up, and is based on either their
Engineering or Burglary skill. The cost of a security system is equal to its
quality. If a character is building a security system for himself, this cost is
reduced by one (quality, of course, stays the same).</p>
<p>Most often a security system should be defeated (or not) in a single roll.
Failing that roll should make the matter more complicated – increasing
difficulty or revealing that there are multiple steps that must be taken in
order to make the job even possible – if not outright setting off any security
measures that the character was trying to circumvent.</p>
<p>If the scene is a big and important one, with a complex security set-up in
order to allow a Burglary focused character to strut his stuff, the GM is
encouraged to start things right at the “multiple steps” point. Such security systems may often be indicated by aspects on the scene, and a player
trying to get around them may be trying to alter or otherwise remove those
aspects from the scene. Alternately, the systems may have a stress track
of their own, with the character’s Burglary actions acting as “infiltration
attacks” against the securities and failsafes.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id776" id="id73" name="id73">8.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacting</a></h3>
<p>The main difference between Contacting with and without stunts is the quality
of the people you’re going to deal with. Every organization that a character
tries to get an inroad into with Contacting is going to have a certain amount
of bureaucratic smokescreens in place. A character’s reputation, without a
stunt, can only get him so far. Thus, without an appropriate stunt, characters
will end up contacting the lowest level functionary of the highest level of the
organization – that is to say, its middle managers, sergeants and other
mid-level folks, falling well short of the big cheese at the top … unless the
storyline’s set up for such access. This isn’t to say that a stuntless
character can’t eventually get there – just that it’ll take more work, or at
least money. In a vacuum, easy access to heads of state, generals, and capos
are in the domain of stunts (though it might be bought with a little creative
use of Resources).</p>
<p>Whenever it comes into play, Contacting is the GM’s excuse to have a little bit
of fun. Remember that information from Contacting always comes from a person.
While the GM is not obliged to play out every Contacting roll, it’s always an
excuse to get a chance to play a brief scene with a colorful NPC – and players
being what they are, if you make the NPC interesting enough, they’ll want more
of him. If you don’t enjoy that, no problem, just hand over the information.
But if you do enjoy it, here’s your chance!</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id778" id="id75" name="id75">◉ Getting the Tip-Off [Contacting]</a></h4>
<p>Getting the Tip-Off is actually a bit of a dirty trick. It’s a bonus to the
player, but it also creates a hook to draw them in – no one is going to be
indifferent to a warning of a threat against themselves. However, make sure
that the information in the tip off is either very vague or very specific. If
it’s vague enough to serve as foreshadowing, it’s unlikely to distract the
character, but if there’s any amount of detail, there’s a good chance the
player will concentrate on this tip-off as something they must do next. As
such, the advice for gathering information also applies to tip-offs – if it’s
information that could be acted upon, the course of action should be obvious.</p>
<p>For example, if a hit man has been called in from Chicago to kill the
character, an appropriately vague warning is “I heard you really got a hair up
Mister Big’s nose. You should watch out .” A decently specific tip-off is
“Iceman Jenkins is in town, over at the southside motel! They say he’s got a
gang of guys and is here to whack you! You need to get outta town!” Something
in the middle, like “There’s a hitter in town, and he’s after your head,” is
potentially problematic, because the player may well become obsessed with
tracking down this hitter, rather than dealing with whatever else is afoot.</p>
<p>The Iceman Jenkins tip-off at least says “to deal with this, you can go to the
southside motel right now!” whereas “there’s a hitter in town” suggests that
it’s simply the first step in a longer investigation to discover the identity of
the hitter and, if necessary, neutralize him. If it’s your intention to kick off
a potentially long investigation sub-plot, great – your tip-off is right what
you want it to be. But if that’s not your intention, you’ve created a wrinkle
for yourself that you’re going to burn some game time on smoothing out.</p>
<p>Regardless, you need to be sensitive, as with any kind of investigation, to
making sure that the process you kick off with a tip is not simply a parade
of frustrating dead ends. Tips should head somewhere!</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, like Alertness, don’t have the character roll for a tipoff
unless you have something to tell the character. To do otherwise is just mean!</p>

<p>People say you can’t con an honest man, and there’s a good reason for
it. Even the most persuasive lie can only suggest a course of action, not
compel one. At best, a lie can suggest that a given course of action is in the
target’s best interest, but even if that’s convincing, some people still won’t
take the bait because it violates their convictions.</p>
<p>What this means is that you need to be very careful about adjudicating
Taken Out results in social conflicts where Deceit is in play. Deceit should
never create behavior that is at odds with the basic nature of the target – an
honest man won’t be tricked into stealing, for example, though he may be
tricked into, say, holding stolen goods if he has no reason to think they’re
stolen.</p>
<p>When Deceit is most successful, the target is put in a position where his
own nature forces the decision that the liar wanted him to make, much the
same way the compulsion of an aspect does. An honest man won’t steal,
unless he feels he has to do so to protect something more important than
his honesty. Part of the reason a character with a high Deceit is going to
want a decent Empathy is to know what direction to spin things towards.</p>
<p>In any case, this is not a huge problem when Deceit is used on NPCs –
though you should keep an eye out just to make sure the character doesn’t
use Deceit as poor man’s mind control. But when players are taken out by a
Deceit attack, it’s important to remember that they may believe something
false to be true now, but it should not change their essential nature.</p>

<p>Disguises generally hold up until the worst possible moment. The trick with
dealing with disguises is less about when the opposition wins a roll, and more
about when the opposition is going to get close enough to use Investigate.
That’s the trump card, and the way to play out tension in a scene with
disguises is by making it clear such a roll could happen – and thus the

<p>In such a contest, the “reader” is effectively maneuvering (as he attempts
to win an Empathy roll and pick up a piece of information) rather than
attacking, but he is acting, so he does not get a full defense bonus. The
deceiver is responding in kind with attacks and maneuvers as well, with the
goal of planting false ideas on the reader. Usually, the opponent disengages

<p>First thing to remember: Cars of the pulp era are just not that fast compared
to the cars of today (45 miles per hour is the blistering top speed of a Model
T). You want to bear that in mind when players want to jump the crick or try a
bootlegger reverse. Now, this is pulp, so feel free to play a little fast and
loose with the physics of it, but just remember that the baseline is lower than
in the modern era.</p>
<p>If racing a car against something other than a car, refer to the guidelines on

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id784" id="id81" name="id81">◉ Chases [Drive]</a></h4>
<p>Despite the caveat about speed, Drive mostly comes up in one important context:
chases! Sure, sometimes there will be rolls against specific difficulties to
get out of a burning building in time or the like, but really, if a character
has a substantial Drive skill, it’s so he can come away as the winner of a car
chase.</p>
<p>So here’s the first rule of chases: they aren’t about speed. Sure, in a
straightaway, the faster vehicle wins, no question, but that should almost
never happen. Car (or any other kind of vehicle) chases end when one party is
no longer in the chase, usually because they’ve crashed violently (and possibly
explosively).</p>
<p>Car chases play out like any other conflict, with one or two small differences.
Vehicles have their own stress track (see Gadgets &amp; Gizmos, page XX), but they
do not “attack” each other as is normally the case in a conflict. Instead, they
engage in a steadily escalating series of dangerous actions, until the lesser
driver is weeded out.</p>
<p>At each exchange in a chase, the driver of the lead (“chased”) vehicle calls
out an action. Even if other things are happening at the same time as the
chase, this action declaration is made first, regardless of initiative. The
driver declares a difficulty of his choice, and describes what complicated and
dangerous maneuver he’s performing that this difficulty matches. He then makes
a Drive roll against that difficulty.</p>
<p>If he succeeds, he pulls it off, but if he fails, it goes less well than
planned – the car gets banged up some or slips out of control, and the car
takes stress equal to the number of shifts the character missed the difficulty
by (as if an opponent had rolled the difficulty as an attack).</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Next, the driver of the pursuing vehicle (see below if there’s more than one
vehicle) rolls against the same difficulty. If successful, the car takes no
stress and inflicts stress to the lead car according to the shifts on its roll
as it manages to get close, slam bumpers, fire some shots, or otherwise make
trouble.</p>
<p>Alternately, if the pursuer is not looking to damage the lead vehicle, he may
roll for a maneuver. If he fails, his car takes stress as if the difficulty
were an attack – poor driving or overzealousness has had him sideswipe a
vegetable stand, or rip up his tires on a tight turn.</p>
<p>Eventually one party or the other will be taken out, and that should pretty
well handle that – if the chased vehicle’s still in motion, an escape; if a
pursuing vehicle’s in play, capture!</p>

<p>Now, this is all well and good for when one car is chasing another, but chases
are usually a lot more crazy than that – it’s a lucky hero who is only pursued
by only one vehicle! Usually, if one car goes down, another one is in its
place, and villains are famous for having guys with grenades on just the right
rooftop as the hero tries to get away.</p>
<p>Multiple vehicle chases usually use the minion rules (see page XX), with each
car equating to a minion, and all of the pursuers acting as a single unit
making a single roll. If there’s a named pursuer with a handful of unnamed
companions, the minion vehicles attach to the named leader normally.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>However, if there are a lot of cars – say you have a named pursuer who has 10
minions – it’s a little hard (and anticlimactic) to have all of the vehicles on
the field at once. When you look at movies and the like, the usual pattern is
that a few cars show up in pursuit, they crash, and new cars come in to take
their place, and this process repeats until there are no more reinforcements.</p>
<p>With that in mind, when you want to play out a more extended chase that has
this kind of pacing, the Chase Scene rules become appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id786" id="o-chase-scenes-drive" name="o-chase-scenes-drive">◉ Chase Scenes [Drive]</a></h4>
<p>Chase scenes occur when the players are being pursued by a large enemy force.
In a chase scene, the named pursuer stays out of the chase, at least initially.
Over the course of the chase, the pursuing minions come at the player
sequentially, with a new minion coming in as a prior one is taken out. This
continues for the duration of the chase until the pursuer is out of minions, at
which point, he enters the fray and the chase is then resolved normally.</p>
<p>Because the pursuer is not on the field, the minions never attach, so they use
their own skill, which is often to the fleeing character’s benefit. In return
for this, the pursuing villain is given a few tricks to balance the scales.
(Players, being heroes, don’t use these rules, since they are potent
individuals of action, rather than masterminds working through lackeys.)</p>
<p>At the beginning of a scene, the GM-controlled pursuer is given a certain
number of points, which represent the total value of the pursuit. Five points
makes for a very short chase, 10 for a one meant to be a major feature of this
section of the story, and 20 can make for a chase scene that will take up a
goodly portion of the session, as a climax to the action.</p>
<p>The baseline use of this value is to determine how many minions the pursuing
character has. Each minion costs a number of points based on its value (1 for
Average, 2 for Fair, 3 for Good). At the start of the chase, the pursuer can
spend as many points as he wants (up to the total value of the pursuit) in
order to buy minions. He can choose to have all of these minions go after the
characters now, or he can hold some of them in reserve (in which case the
reserve vehicles will enter the chase one by one, as individual minions are
taken out). Also, at any time there are no pursuing vehicles (i .e ., all the
minions that he’s bought have been taken out), he can spend points to add a
single additional pursuing vehicle, which immediately enters the chase.  More
importantly, the pursuer may also spend 1 point per exchange for any of the
following effects:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Reinforcements</dt>
<dd>Allows the pursuing character to add multiple cars at once. By spending one
point, he may spend additional points up to half his remaining total on
purchasing additional cars, which are immediately added to the field. These
vehicles must all be of the same quality as the car already in play and each
other. Adding extra vehicles allows them to get the bonus for being in a
group, but has the drawback that overflow damage will roll onto the next
vehicle as it does for minions (this does not happen when there is only one
pursuing vehicle).</dd>
<dt>Road Hazard</dt>
<dd>The pursuers have managed to get someone ahead of the lead car and may launch
an attack against the lead car, using the villain’s Drive (or Pilot, when
appropriate) skill as the attack value. Other pursuing vehicles do not need
to defend against this attack, since in theory, at least, they’re aware that
the hazard is forthcoming. This is one of main tools the villain may use to
offset the loss of not involving himself directly.</dd>
<dt>Shotgun!</dt>
<dd>One of the pursuing vehicles has someone with a gun in the passenger seat,
and the addition of bullets into the mix makes things all the more dangerous.
Any time the lead car takes stress, it’s increased by one as long as this guy
is shooting. The guy with the gun can be removed when that car is taken out
(reinforcements do not have a gun unless points are spent for it).</dd>
<dt>The Last Pursuer</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If the pursuing villain is not going to join the fight himself, he can try to
end the chase with one last, tougher-than-usual vehicle.  This is the last
ability the pursuer can use, and costs all his remaining points (minimum of
1). If the Last Pursuer is used, the villain himself cannot subsequently join
the chase.</p>
<p>The last pursuer is always more impressive than the previous vehicles.
Perhaps it’s big and armored, sleek and black, or maybe it’s something
completely unexpected, like a biplane. It is always treated as a Good Minion,
with one extra box of capacity for each point spent beyond the minimum.</p>
<p>It also has one other benefit from this list:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>+3 Stress Boxes</li>
<li>+1 to Drive Rolls</li>
<li>Armed – Always treated as having the Shotgun! Effect.</li>
<li>1 point of armor (see Gadgets and Gizmos, page XX)</li>
<li>Alternate Movement – the pursuer can move in ways the lead vehicle
can’t (such as flying, or water). Mechanically, this means that the
pursuing car can opt to avoid almost any hazard, treating it as if the
pursuer automatically succeeded at the roll, but inflicting no stress on
the pursuer for doing so. The pursuer is only obliged to roll if the lead
car can come up with a maneuver that forces the pursuer to respond.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Dramatic Entrance</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is the moment when the named pursuer reveals himself, and begins the end
of the chase. If the GM has used “The Last Pursuer” already, this option is
off the table. This costs all the the pursuer’s remaining points (minimum 1)
and triggers a Road Hazard for the fleeing vehicle, as the pursuer appears in
a colorful and hopefully hazardous way.  The stats of the pursuer’s vehicle
depend on the pursuer, and if he does not have a signature vehicle, he may
use the same rules as The Last Pursuer, above, replacing the minion quality
with his own skill.</p>
<p class="last">Once the pursuer is out of points <em>and</em> there are no pursuing vehicles left,
the fleeing vehicle finally escapes.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id787" id="o-passengers-drive" name="o-passengers-drive">◉ Passengers [Drive]</a></h4>
<p>Each exchange, one PC or named NPC passenger may assist the driver, provided he has the means to do so. This allows him to contribute to the chase, as long as he finds a way to describe it, be it shooting at the pursuers (Guns), pushing a crate out the back (Might), or just shouting “look out!” when dramatically appropriate (Alertness). The passenger rolls his skill while the driver rolls his Drive as usual, and the driver may use the higher of the two results. (The only limit on this is that the same passenger may not help two exchanges in a row .) Note that this is a single result, not two – for instance, a passenger who is shooting does not get normal attack results, just the ability to let the driver choose between two rolls.  This said, by dint of being passengers in the same vehicle, all characters – even those not able to roll in that exchange – may offer to spend fate points out of their own pool on behalf of the driver, so long as they supply a bit of color dialogue, e.g., “Alleyway ahead!”</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s nothing saying that characters along for the ride can’t
be doing other things that don’t contribute directly to the chase. While
they can only act against the pursuers by partnering with the driver as
described above, there’s nothing to say that your car chase can’t feature the
Academics guy in the back seat furiously trying to read through the book
the heroes just stole from the villain’s lair… just in case the guy’s minions
catch up with them and the book returns to its owner.</p>
<p>The reason for these rules are twofold. First, if all the passengers were
engaging in full participation at the same time, the chase would finish very
quickly and would almost certainly be less interesting. But second and perhaps
more important, by focusing the chase experience around the person in the
driver’s seat, the driver’s shtick of being good at driving gets backed up.
Chases are uncommon enough that, when the opportunity to shine comes up, the
driver should most certainly get the spotlight.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id789" id="id83" name="id83">◉ Reading People [Empathy]</a></h4>
<p>Knowing someone’s aspects is a powerful tool, both because it allows that
person to tag them, and because it gives potent insight into the target’s
nature. It’s critical to remember that a character’s aspects are not
necessarily public knowledge. While a scenario may call for compelling a
character’s aspects, NPCs should not be planning for that aspect unless they
have some reason to have found it out, either because the player showcases it,
or because they’ve successfully used Empathy on the character.</p>
<p>When you decide which NPC aspects Empathy reveals to a player, there are two
possible yardsticks. The first is showcasing those aspects you feel are closest
to who the NPC really is. The second is showcasing the ones you think would be
most entertaining if the player found out about. If neither of those yardsticks
work, pick the one closest to the top of the list; it’s probably reflective of
what you thought was most essential at the time.</p>

<p>To handle a scene where you feel fatigue should be an issue, use Endurance
to limit the primary skill (similar to the use of Alertness and Resolve).</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id791" id="o-poisons-endurance" name="o-poisons-endurance">◉ Poisons [Endurance]</a></h4>
<p>Poisons are an interesting case, and one that bears some discussion, since
they fall into a few categories which in turn follow a few rules.</p>
<p>Poisons have a potency and a subtlety, both rated on the adjective ladder.  The
potency determines how hard it is to resist using Endurance (see below) and the
subtlety is the difficulty for any Alertness, Investigation or Science rolls to
detect or analyze it – either to prevent exposure, or to determine the cause of
someone’s sudden ailment. Poisons also need to have a means of application,
such either as food, gas or injection.</p>
<p>First, we have damaging poisons. Damage is used loosely here, as it may
be lethal or it may mean knockout drugs or any number of other things.</p>
<p>Damaging poisons are often fast-acting, found on the blades of enemies
and tips of blowgun darts. When such a poison is introduced into the
system, it makes an attack (at its level of potency – Mediocre for a mild
poison, Superb for something very potent) against the target’s Endurance.</p>
<p>This attack occurs before the first initiative of an exchange. This attack
repeats every exchange until the end of the scene (at which point the poison
has run its course) or until the character somehow stops the poison, such as
with a stunt or medical treatment (or even something as mundane as inducing
vomiting when appropriate). Many such poisons may stop if the player acquires
spin on his defending Endurance roll (beating the attack by 3 or more).</p>
<p>Some damaging poisons are slow acting and kill over a much longer period of
time, but those are often more appropriate for background than showing up
directly in play. If you are looking to introduce a slower-acting poison,
rather than treating it as a standard attack, make a roll once per scene
against the victim’s Endurance roll. If the poison’s roll beats the Endurance
roll by 3 or more, then the victim acquires a consequence. Regardless of
severity, these consequences do not disappear until after the poison is cured.
After three such rolls, escalating from minor to moderate to severe, the fourth
will leave the victim succumbing, with a taken out result. Alas, with poisons,
there are no concessions!</p>
<p>Next, we have exotic drugs. Rather than damaging their target, they put one or
more additional aspects directly on them (as with a maneuver rather than an
attack). Their potency is the value which the subject rolls their Endurance
against in a simple test. If the subject wins, the symptoms are passing, but if
he loses, he immediately gains the aspects as described in the poison. The
duration of these effects depends upon the poison. This approach is
specifically different from a slow-acting damaging poison, as these aspects are
not consequences, and thus do not push the character closer to taken out.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have special poisons. These are the poisons that violate the rules
in some way and tend to either leave a beloved NPC in a coma, needing a very
exotic cure, or will kill the person who has been exposed in a fixed period of
time so they must race to find the antidote. Alternately, they may have killed
someone in a very peculiar way and may prove the only clue to the killer’s
location.</p>
<p>In short, these are poisons that serve no purpose but to motivate the plot.
That’s OK! Pulp can tolerate a little bit of cliché, but try to keep their use
to a minimum unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id792" id="id85" name="id85">8.3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering</a></h3>
<p>Most of the guidelines for Engineering can be found in the Gadgets and Gizmos
chapter, page XX. For explosives, jump to the end of this chapter, page XX.</p>
<p>Engineering requires a workshop, the same way Academics requires a Library and
Science requires a Lab. While Engineering can have very potent effects, it’s
fairly time-consuming to work something up in game time. Frequently, a
gadgeteer character will have multiple ranks of the Universal Gadget stunt to
help speed this process along. If the character does not have enough
improvements from stunts to buy a gadget outright, he can use the stunt’s
improvements to reduce the time required.</p>
<p>For example, a device with 3 improvements usually requires 24 hours to make. If
the engineer uses his Universal Gadget stunt’s two improvements to cover part
of those improvements, the gadget will only take 8 hours to build (see page XX
for more on the gadget improvement process and timeframes).  Engineering
improvements do not last from session to session, so if a player wants to start
play with a gadget, he should buy a stunt to reflect it. With that in mind, you
should not be giving players the opportunity to engineer for its own sake. If
the pacing of the game is giving everyone time to stop by the workshop for a
few days to upgrade their guns, that is a sign that you badly need to increase
the urgency of the threat facing the players. Pulp gadgetry is done under the
gun, with the clock ticking down to a dire midnight (see “Keeping it Pulpy”,
page XX).</p>
<p>For devices that have stress tracks, the difficulty of repair is the quality of
the device. Removing stress or a mild consequence takes a few hours, a day for
a moderate consequence, and a week for a severe consequence. For devices that
don’t have stress tracks, the difficulty is based off the highest value of the
device, or its resources cost, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Failure on a repair roll can be made up in a few ways, retroactively. First,
each additional step longer on the time chart (page XX) gives a retroactive +1
to the player’s roll, up to a maximum of +4 for four steps on the table.
Second, the device can be repaired on the usual timeframe, but, the quality
drops by one for every point shy of the target. Both methods may be combined; a
character can get a retroactive +3 to take two steps longer and drop the
quality of the item by one. Degradation in item quality may mean that some of
its special abilities are lost, if it has any. Subsequent efforts may be made
to restore the item to its original quality, but those face a difficulty equal
to the target quality, plus one for every two steps the current quality is
below the target. Missing a restoration roll can only be made up by investing
time, and the starting length of time on such efforts is usually a week.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>If the GM agrees to it, a player may make a partial repair when falling just
short of the target. In these cases, the consequence on the device being
repaired is downgraded in severity, rather than being entirely removed. If the
character misses the roll by one, he may opt to downgrade the consequence,
regardless of its severity, to a mild one. If the character misses the roll by
two, he may opt to downgrade the consequence one step, taking severe to
moderate and moderate to mild. If the consequence is mild in any of these
cases, it is removed, but the device’s stress boxes are all filled to the point
of one shy of “taken out”.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id793" id="id86" name="id86">8.3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fists</a></h3>
<p>Most of the issues with Fists come up in combat and are addressed there
(page XX). One thing to bear in mind with Fists (and Weapons and Guns,
for that matter) is that they are balanced on the level of the skills rather
than the situation. That means that the system is designed based on the
assumption that a fight between a character with Fists and a character with
Weapons is a fair fight because the Fists guy always has a “weapon” but
can do little to extend its capabilities, while the Weapons guy may be at an
advantage or disadvantage due to his choice of, and dependency upon, a
weapon.</p>
<p>This can be jarring for some people, because it means that we are not giving a
bonus to the weapons guy for having “superior weaponry” or the like.  The
reasoning is simple enough – the fight is about the people involved, not the
trappings – but this can be a problem when the weapons should give some obvious
advantage, like reach.</p>
<p>In those situations, there are two ways to go. First, in the small set of
situations where the guy with Fists shouldn’t be able to attack, then don’t let
him. As an example, if there’s a chain link fence between the combatants, and
the guy with a weapon is jabbing his spear through, the Fists guy just isn’t
going the be able to counterattack, simple as that (though he may defend).
These should be obvious, common sense solutions, and if they’re not, then
consider the second option.</p>
<p>The second option is more appropriate when there seems like there could be some
disparity, such as when the character’s weapon provides an advantage of reach
which should help out. In those situations, it falls on the head of the
disadvantaged fighter to describe the actions in such a way that it
acknowledges the disparity. As long as he does so, there is no penalty.  If he
fails to do so, it may be appropriate to impose a -1 penalty on his actions
until a plan for counteracting the disadvantage is done. This plan need not
involve anything more complicated than a free action and a bit of color
description, but sometimes, it may require something more than a free action.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Effectively, this is just mandating color, but it saves a lot of headaches.
Players may respond well to bare-fisted characters starting a fight out with a
brief penalty, even if it’s one that’s easily discarded, so don’t be afraid of
feeling like an ogre for penalizing them out the door – just be ready and
willing to penalize your own fist-swinging NPCs similarly!</p>
<p>And if you really want to make a point of weapon advantage, bring a little back
and forth into it – maybe the Fists user is describing ways to deal with the
presence of a weapon, but the Weapons user gets to reassert the penalty on a
subsequent exchange by using his weapon in a new and unexpected way. Mix it up
a little!</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id794" id="id87" name="id87">8.3.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling</a></h3>
<p>(Skill, page XX; Stunts, page XX)</p>
<p>If a player has bothered to put Gambling anywhere on his character sheet, he’s
casting a vote for gambling to be a factor in your games where he’s playing.
Make sure to keep that in mind, and always have in the back of your head an
idea for a cool gambling vignette that ties into your storyline!</p>
<p>In practice, Gambling requires striking a balance between cool scenes and
boring play. The moment that matters in a gambling scene is the last one, when
everything is on the line and the last card gets turned over. Compared to that,
playing out each hand of cards can be numbingly boring.</p>
<p>It’s possible to play out a gambling contest as an extended social conflict,
but there are only limited circumstances where that’s appropriate. Instead,
Gambling scenes should usually be picked up in medias res. Give a quick rundown
of who’s at the table, making sure to include their body language, before
picking up with the gambler character and the fall of the dice. If the
character beats the quality of the game (equivalent to the Resources value of
what’s staked), he walks out with the pot. If issue that brought the character
to the game is a vital one, this may be too quick a shorthand – or, at the
least, you should be ready for a lot of aspect use to hit the table.</p>
<p>Once won, the pot allows the character to make a single Resources check using
the pot’s value rather than his Resources skill – assuming the pot is something
as mundane as cash or easily-liquidated items of little importance otherwise.
Under more exotic circumstances, such as a high stakes game, the pot may
contain all manner of unusual things – maybe giving the character a temporary
gadget for the session, or kicking off an entire storyline on its own. (More on
that shortly.)</p>
<p>If the character loses a game and doesn’t have the Resources to cover the pot,
he’ll have to go into debt. Make a note of the debt on the character sheet.
This is not that big a problem for most games, not even significant enough
to merit a temporary aspect – the character simply can’t get into another
game until it’s paid off. Or rather, he can still get in, but it requires beating
the quality of the game with his Deceit skill to try to sneak in passing as
someone else.</p>
<p>If the game is high stakes (where the pot is two ranks higher than the game’s
quality) then things get more interesting. If the character wins a high stakes
game, the pot should include at least one odd thing, like a mysterious
artifact, someone’s wedding ring, a writ for someone’s soul, the services of a
bondsman, an ancient sword, a life debt, and so on. For games of a Good or
lower quality, this item is usually just a curiosity, but for Great or better
games, this item is important enough that the player takes it as a temporary
aspect, and it remains on his sheet until he resolves it, usually because you
will use the item as a hook for one of his upcoming adventures.  A character
may only have one such aspect at a time, so until it’s resolved, high stakes
wins are only worth the pot.</p>
<p>If a character <em>loses</em> a high stakes game, that may be very bad indeed. He
marks down the debt as a temporary aspect, but his problems are not limited to
money. His debt will usually be picked up by someone important who will demand
a favor or some other payment to resolve the debt. Until that happens, everyone
knows the character owes someone big, and he will not be welcome at high stakes
games.</p>

<p>(Skill, page XX; Stunts, page XX)</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the main advantage of guns in this game is that they
offer a range advantage; despite their lethality, they’re no more dangerous in
a fight than fists, knives, chains or anything else. This is a genre decision –
making guns more lethal quickly moves things away from pulp and into noir,
which is not bad, but not the goal of this game. The advice under Fists (page
XX) for handling mismatches in weaponry applies to Guns as well.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id796" id="o-ammunition-guns" name="o-ammunition-guns">◉ Ammunition [Guns]</a></h4>
<p>One thing that inevitably comes up when dealing with guns is how many shots one
has left. Thing is, aside from tracking how much clip capacity every type of
gun has, counting bullets is just not a valid approach, because a character may
actually fire off their weapon many times in a given exchange, with the outcome
summarized in one roll. To a great extent, reloading is considered to be just
part of the flow of a fight and the use of the Guns skill.</p>
<p>With that in mind, running out of ammunition is something that only happens
when it’s dramatic and interesting, which is to say, when it’s something
appropriate for the application of aspects. Running out of ammunition is a
legitimate compel for a character with gun-related aspects, but even more, it’s
an excellent first consequence or concession, or the possible result of a
maneuver (such as using Athletics to run all over the place, drawing fire and
getting the bad guys to expend their ammunition).</p>
<p>Shy of this, if you want the flavor of a reload without the drama, simply be
reasonable and request that the character take a supplemental action
(basically, a -1 to his next roll) to reload after every three or four
exchanges of sustained gunfire.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id797" id="id89" name="id89">8.3.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimidation</a></h3>
<p>Intimidation requires a reason for fear, however tenuous. This makes it hard to
intimidate someone over the telephone unless you have something very specific
to threaten them with. This is the most important thing to bear in mind when
deciding how vulnerable an NPC is to Intimidation or how intimidating an NPC
is. Without a reason for fear, Intimidation will produce, at best, annoyance,
and at worst, explosive anger. Then again, that can be a goal for its use too…
Regardless of whether or not there is a reason for fear, a potent success on an
Intimidation roll should produce a strong emotional response – just not,
necessarily, one that was intended, nor that is controlled.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id798" id="id90" name="id90">8.3.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation</a></h3>
<p>As with Alertness (page XX), when in doubt, set the difficulties low. You never
want to derail your own game because players failed to find a clue at the crime
scene. It may seem like it makes life less interesting if there is no challenge
in the Investigation roll, but this is one of those odd situations where that
is not the case. A lack of information is clearly frustrating to players, and
if you have a player who really savors the challenge of figuring out clues, the
challenge is usually less in finding the clues than in figuring out what they
mean once they’re found. And there’s the rub: clues don’t come with
explanations baked right in. Position your mystery in the clues they find, not
in the clues they don’t.</p>
<p>Remember, unless there’s something actually there for them to find, don’t make
them roll. You’ll have a much healthier game if you just say, “Nah, don’t roll
– after a bit of searching it’s clear there’s nothing here,” and get moving on
to the next eventful thing. Don’t give your players the opportunity to “waste”
a really good Investigation roll on finding out that there’s nothing to find
out!</p>
<p>In general, characters will use Investigation in two possible ways. Either they
will be searching an area for whatever they can find (such as when searching
for a clue) or they will be looking for something specific.  When searching for
something specific, the difficulty of the Investigation roll should be kept at
Mediocre, with the shifts on the result being used as a yardstick for how long
it takes to find the thing.</p>
<p>The only exception to this is if you (the GM) have a reason the thing in
question shouldn’t be found. In those situations, it’s often better to just
make the thing unfindable due to a critical missing piece that would “unlock”
access to the otherwise unfindable objective (if so, don’t make them roll;
instead, put them on the path to discovering what that missing piece is). This
missing piece could be equipment, like X-Ray specs, or the utterance of a
certain codeword, like “Open Sesame”, or something else entirely. Once that
piece is in place, the difficulty should drop back to the usual level. And
remember, if there’s no chance of success, here, don’t make the players roll
for it – that’s just rude.</p>
<p>If characters are just searching an area for clues, the guidelines for
Alertness very strongly apply. Set the base difficulty at Mediocre, and make
sure that players can find <em>something</em>. Once characters find things, the burden
is on you to make sure that whatever they find suggests a course of action.
Even a red herring should suggest something, sending the characters into a
situation that deepens or complicates the plot. The good news is that if
players know what they’re looking for, they usually already have a pretty good
idea of what they’re going to do with whatever they find. For clues that you
provide, you’re going to have to put some thought into what comes next.</p>
<p>One of the tricky things about clues is how much to explain when you give one.
If you give a piece of information that seems like it suggests a clear
direction, but your players don’t seem to see it, there’s a temptation to
explain the significance of the clue to the players to push them in the right
direction. This may do in an absolute pinch, but it’s an easy way to frustrate
players – it can feel like you’re leading them around by the nose, and that
breaks the feeling of heroism you’re striving to create, because it undermines
their role as protagonists.</p>
<p>If the players are talking about what the clue might mean, or have some other
direction to pursue, don’t sweat it for the time being. If they’re working on
it, and they’re interested in it, then all is well in the world.  Similarly, if
they’re pursuing something else, they’re busy, and it gives you time to drop in
new hints. It’s only if things look like they’re in danger of slowing down
should you resort to interpreting things for the players. The exception is when
a player explicitly asks you something like “What does this mean?” or “What
would I know about this?” When that happens, it’s an opportunity to be as
forthcoming as you feel you need to.</p>
<p>Investigation can be to used, in a somewhat more radical application, as the
skill to put some control of the story into the players’ hands. Consider the
“Declaring Minor Details” trapping of Academics – a declaration action – as it
might apply to Investigation. If your group’s up for it, why not allow the same
sort of trapping for Investigation? This would allow your investigators to make
Sherlock Holmes-like declarations, asserting minor details about a crime scene,
say, and backing up the truth of their assertions with a successful
Investigation roll. Sure, this may mean that you’ve lost some control over the
storyline yourself, but if you’re up to facing this sort of challenge, the
effect on your players could be electrifying.</p>
<p>There are occasions when a clue <em>should</em> be frustrating – for the characters.
This shouldn’t happen often, and usually only very early in a session. Such
clues should always make sense later on in the adventure; otherwise. they’re
just frustrating. The best such clue should be designed so players go “Ah!” and
may be even better when paired with other, more explicit clues that suggest
action. For more on clues and information management in a game, see page XX.</p>

<p>Players may have a little bit of this skill for the bureaucracy parts, and
maybe the occasional act of battlefield leadership, but this skill is more of a
villain thing. Why? Villains have minions, simple as that.</p>
<p>Taking a lot of leadership tends to indicate that the player is most interested
in being in charge of something, and while that should be encouraged to a
certain point, this can be a red flag if the player is too disinclined to get
his own hands dirty. A character who is a mastermind who directs things from
the shadows makes for an interesting story, but is fairly dull to play. Make
sure the player doesn’t have an expectation of not getting involved. If he
seems overly attached to the idea, see if he’s willing to consider making a
character who works for this guy in the shadows, and then take <em>him</em> as an
aspect.</p>

<p>This is a villain trick. It lets you make villains who don’t have much
combat skill themselves, but who can still help out their minions in a fight.</p>
<p>Assuming a villain has Good minions attached to himself, if his combat skill is
better than Good, then he’ll usually be attached to those minions and rolling
his own skill. Characters with a high Leadership, on the other hand, can get by
without any combat skills because they can make a small quantity of Good
minions into Superb (+1 for numbers, +1 for command) combatants, which is very
potent.</p>
<p>A hero can do all of these things too, but in such situations the word “hero”
is pronounced “chicken”.</p>

<p>Might is a pretty simple skill to use, and it should be remembered that it

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id802" id="id94" name="id94">◉ Breaking Things [Might]</a></h4>
<p>Given time and tools, pretty much anything can be broken. In general
there are two ways to break something: methodical and abrupt.</p>
<p>To break something methodically generally requires no rolling. Given
time and tools, you can eventually break anything. How long it will take is
mostly just a matter of common sense, ranging from a few moments to saw
a board, to decades to scratch through a door with a spoon. This is usually
done off-screen, and a Might (or Engineering roll) might do to get a sense
for how well or quickly the job is done, but if no one is interrupting or
otherwise involved, it will work sooner or later.</p>
<p>If it’s necessary to break up a methodical roll into something measurable,
you may call for a number of rolls and tally shifts to get a sense of progress,
but that is ultimately more a narrative convenience than a real measure of
difficulty. In short, if you want to interrupt a methodical effort with things
like enemy attacks, you can certainly call for a roll between each interruption, but make sure you know what those rolls mean. If they aren’t actually
going to affect the speed of the progress, then you’re just rolling to maintain pacing. There’s nothing wrong with that (see “Testing the Breeze”,
page XX), but it’s important to remember why you’re doing it.</p>
<p>Breaking something abruptly is more dramatic – knocking down a door,
splitting a board with one’s hands, bending iron bars and so on. That’s just
a quick roll against a difficulty based upon the target’s nature. Having an
appropriate tool (like a hammer, crowbar, or axe) may reduce the difficulty
by up to two.</p>

<p>A character can try to push themselves into the next category, which requires a
Might roll against his own Might skill as the target difficulty, and if
successful (the dice don’t come up negative), he may perform a single Might
action at the next category up.  Appropriate use of tools can increase this
capacity, using anything from a lever (which may grant a bonus) to a pulley
system (which may outright multiply capacity).</p>
<p>This may seem like a number-heavy approach in what has otherwise been a fairly
abstract system, but the reason for this is pretty simple. People are used to
thinking in terms of weight when talking about how heavy something is, and they
have certain expectations that the 90 pound weakling is not going to have “a
good roll” and carry more than the trained power-lifter.</p>
<p>The exception to this is the famous idea of a mother’s pulling a car off her
child – people are known to perform heroic acts of strength when there is a
need, and as this is a heroic game, it is only appropriate that we support
that.</p>
<p>The trick in those situations lies in the fact that the line between Lift and
Break is sometimes fuzzy. If someone is trapped under rubble and you want to
get it off them, if you do it carefully, that’s an appropriate use of lift.  If
it’s a moment of panic, ripping aside something heavy to free a loved one,
well, then the guidelines for breaking things are more appropriate, and the
amount the character can remove (lift) is based off their roll. While this may
seem like a tricky distinction, it’s actually very easy to distinguish in play.
When in doubt, look and see if the character has any personal aspects that
might apply. If so, then this may be a moment of passion.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work, and for lifting things, it’s a simple matter
of adding each person’s capacity to figure out the total pounds the group
can lift. For abruptly breaking things, gain an additional +1 to the roll for
each person helping who can practically pitch in. This is usually one or two
people.</p>

<p>This is not a game where we’re going to make characters empty out their
pockets to figure out exactly how much they are carrying. For the most
part, day to day equipment and clothing is just not an issue. From time to
time, however, a character may need to perform an action while carrying
a large amount of weight, like a bomb that’s ticking down or a wounded
buddy slung over their shoulder.</p>
<p>A character can easily carry something that is 4 steps lower than their lifting
capacity without a problem. Now, remember common sense applies – just because
Dan Dynamite can run at full tilt while carrying 100 pounds of TNT doesn’t mean
he can do so all day. Trying to do so for more than a scene calls for an
Endurance roll against the weight of the load, and additional rolls each
subsequent scene, with the difficulty going up by 1 each time!</p>
<p>For each step heavier than this carrying capacity, the character takes a -1 on
all other physical action, up to a maximum of -4 (-5 if they’re really pushing
themselves). This may also lead the GM to demand that the character start
performing all skill rolls limited by his Endurance skill.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id806" id="id96" name="id96">8.3.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysteries</a></h3>
<p>This is an odd skill, and if a player chooses it for his character, it is a
vote for a little bit of weirdness in the game. While pulp (and this game) is
strongly rooted in early 20th Century science fiction, Mysteries occupies that
fuzzy fringe where things that look supernatural live, even if they have
explanations that sound scientific. Psychic phenomena of various stripes have
been the subject of serious scientific study over the years, and in a pulp
game, Mysteries is the skill focused on such study. The importance of Mysteries
is going to depend a lot on the tone of your game – Mysteries has a strong
presence in games influenced by The Shadow or the writings of H .P. Lovecraft,
but much less so in a game of science heroes.</p>
<p>When a player decides to invest heavily in Mysteries, make sure to sit down and
talk to him a little bit about what his expectation for the ability is – while
one player may want to play the man of mysteries, cloaked in shadows, another
may want to play the academic or scientific crackpot, using Mysteries to
explain their bogus theories. Most importantly, make sure that Mysteries is
going to be a good match for your group and your game. If you don’t feel that
Mysteries adds anything useful to the game, there is no harm in simply
disallowing the skill and its stunts (or making it a solely “bad guy” skill).</p>
<p>When using Mysteries to do research, think of it as Academics for crazy people.
Mechanically it’s no different from Academics, but the material found will
usually be tracts by madmen, obscure prophecies, and dark books bound in human
skin. With that in mind, remember that libraries suitable for Mysteries
research are rare and should always be colorful, and are occasionally in
locations that may be an adventure in and of themselves to reach.</p>

<p>Mysteries as a sixth sense follows the same guidelines as Alertness – set difficulties low and make sure the information is something usable. Of course,
the fun thing about Mysteries is that you are less obliged to make the information useful so long as it’s colorful. Things like “there’s an oppressive
sense of darkness” don’t necessarily mean anything, but they can add color
to a scene and give the player a sense of secret knowledge, which is pretty
satisfying, even if it’s based in a vague phrase of foreshadowing.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id808" id="id98" name="id98">◉ Mesmerism [Mysteries]</a></h4>
<p>Mesmerism is one place you may need to rein in player expectations. There are
stunts that allow for more cinematic effects if a player is interested in that.
Unless noted in a stunt, all mesmerism effects require a <em>willing</em> target and a
roll of Mysteries versus Resolve, though the mesmerist gets a +2 on the roll if
the target is actively participating (lying back, relaxing, otherwise really
getting into it). Again, if the target flat-out unwilling, it will simply not
work.</p>
<p>When using mesmerism to help someone remember something, the mesmerist rolls a
quick contest of Mysteries against the target’s Resolve. If successful, the
target may act as if he has the Scene of the Crime Investigation stunt for the
scene in question, but his skill is restricted by the mesmerist’s Mysteries
skill. Thus, if a character with a Great Investigation skill is put under by a
Good Hypnotist, the memories are a little fuzzy, and he treats his
Investigation as if it were Good (Great - 1) for purposes of what he can
remember.</p>
<p>Putting a character in a calming trance reduces all of his perception skills to
Poor, but allows him to use the mesmerist’s Mysteries skill in lieu of his
Resolve skill (which may temporarily improve his composure capacity).  The
mesmerized person also leaves the decision regarding whether or not to resist
an aspect compel in the hands of the mesmerist (the mesmerist may contribute
fate points of his own to turn down a compulsion).  Unfortunately, the
character is also unable to take any action other than what the mesmerist
directs. While a mesmerist may misuse this trust, any shock, surprise, or
suggestion that the character would find repellent will knock them out of the
trance instantly.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id809" id="id99" name="id99">◉ Fortune Telling [Mysteries]</a></h4>
<p>Fortune Telling difficulties follow the same principles as a declaration
action, though with slightly different criteria for the difficulty. The base
difficulty is Mediocre, and the three criteria to judge a whether a prediction
can be made are specifics, presentation, and obscurity.</p>
<p>First off, predictions should never be too specific. To predict that good
fortune will come to your family is nicely broad, but to predict that your
sister will get some money is a bit too specific.</p>
<p>Obscurity is a complementary component to specifics. A good fortune usually is
cloaked in metaphor and can be taken in a number of different ways. Saying that
fortune will come to your family may be specific, but saying that a flower
shall blossom in the garden of your blood is specific and obscure.</p>
<p>Lastly, presentation is all about how the fortune is told. Just rattling off a
fortune or reading a horoscope from the paper has no sense of deep mystery. A
proper fortune requires an appropriate set of props, like tarot cards, chicken
bones, tea leaves, the <em>I Ching</em> or something similar, or at least a great show
of ritual and incantation. While the first two criteria are about the “text” of
the prediction the player is trying, this criterion focuses on how well the
player roleplays the revelation of that text.</p>
<p>For each of these criteria which is not met to the GM’s satisfaction, the
difficulty increases by two. If any of these criteria are outright ignored
(such as predicting that “Sam will win at Bingo tonight and walk out with a 100
clams”) that penalty may be increased to 4 or more – in short, if your player
is abusing this, you’re under no obligation to help him.</p>
<p>Only one fortune can be considered to be “in effect” at any given moment (so no
telling a fortune for each character), and it is up to players to make it come
true or not. Basically, when there is a chance that some course of action will
make the prediction be true, that’s when someone can try to invoke the aspect
(assuming the predicting was true in the first place – you’ve got no reason to
tell them until they try), just as with any normal declaration.</p>
<p>The big difference with fortune telling is that a fortune aspect is persistent throughout the story – it’s not tied to a scene, and as such, it casts its
strange light over the entirety of the adventure. Once a player has made
a successful fortune-telling, the GM should be ready to play along as well.
At the least, she should think about how the fortune might come to bear
in the climax towards the end of the session. The occasional compel of the
fortune’s aspect is a great way to toss a few extra fate points to the players
and to remind them that a fortune is very much a genie out of its bottle.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the burden is on the players to make it work. Remember that while
one character is making the prediction, it’s out there for everyone to take
advantage of, and this may mean that the final interpretation is very different
than the initial player intended. That’s a good thing. After all, telling the
future is a tricky business.</p>
<p>You can, however, definitely make it easier for a prediction to come to pass if
you find the prediction particularly interesting (or if you’ve got a particular
twist on the interpretation you want to pursue). As such, one good use for
compels on the fortune is the introduction of obviously foreshadowing
components. As an example, if a character’s fortune is that he will face death
by cats, you can put a bunch of cats in an alley and ask the player (offering a
fate point) if they’re <em>entirely</em> sure this fortune telling is mumbojumbo.</p>

<p>Most of the guidelines for Drive also apply to Pilot, though most chases will
be single-opponent affairs. There’s just a little bit less craziness possible
in the air – if only due to there being fewer planes in operation than cars.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that this is still very early in the age of aviation, and
planes are still in transition from the wooden framed biplanes of the Great War
to the sleeker metal vehicles of World War Two. Long range aircraft are still a
very new idea, and the Zeppelin is still a viable means of long range travel.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s also worth remembering that characters exist a little bit
ahead of the curve, so they may have access to technologies that are not
available to the public (particularly through gadgets). At the very least, this
is certainly true of their adversaries!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id811" id="id101" name="id101">8.3.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapport</a></h3>
<p>Rapport is the fallback social skill. While Empathy, Deceit, and Intimidation
are fairly specific in their applications, Rapport is the catchall that covers
everything else.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id812" id="id102" name="id102">◉ First Impressions [Rapport]</a></h4>
<p>When characters meet an NPC for the first time, their opinion is going to fall
into a fairly narrow band – they’ll have no opinion, or they’ll have a mildly
favorable or mildly unfavorable opinion. Stronger opinions – friendliness,
love, hate and so on tend to be based on some existing knowledge of the person,
and are unlikely to change simply from meeting them.</p>
<p>That said, small differences matter. A clerk who has a bad first impression
of a character might grudgingly help him out, but the character has got no
real reason to trust his work, while a clerk with a good first impression is
likely to remember that third piece of paperwork he needs to fill out which
becomes so much more important when he gets to the border.</p>
<p>When a player first meets an NPC, that NPC’s inclination towards the player
will be negative, neutral, or positive. If you need to determine this on the
fly, rolling a single die should do the job (⊞ for positive, ⊟ for negative).</p>
<p>The player can simply accept this reaction roll, or he can attempt to turn on
the charm, and make a better first impression. To do so, the player rolls
Rapport against the NPC’s Resolve (Mediocre by default). If the player
generates any shifts, he improves the inclination by one step (so negative
becomes neutral and neutral becomes positive and positive remains the same .).
If the player fails badly enough that the target generates some <strong>spin</strong>, then
the impression instead shifts one step for the worse. If the player does so
well that he gains spin himself, then it <em>might</em> be grounds for a reversal from
negative to positive (or <em>extremely</em> negative to, say, merely suspicious),
unless the NPC has a strong reason not to change his mind.</p>
<p>While this will absolutely color the way the scene plays, it should also have
some effect on the game. Before the roll is made, think of something this
NPC can affect. Ideally, you’ll think of this while planning the adventure,
but sometimes you’ll be surprised and need to think quickly. Look at what
the players want from the NPC, and base your decision off that.</p>
<p>What you <em>don’t</em> want to do is make players regret rolling Rapport. For
example, say your characters encounter a clerk and you have them roll Rapport to
establish first impressions. If the NPC is a clerk looking at their paperwork,
you could decide there is a problem with the paperwork which may make trouble
later on. A friendly clerk will spot the problem and warn them, and an
unfriendly one will ignore it, creating a problem. That may seem satisfying on
the surface – the friendly result has averted a problem.  However, it’s
averting a problem that would not have existed in the first place if there had
not been a Rapport roll to affect the clerk’s impressions.</p>
<p>A first impression is the possibility to introduce an NPC that will either
enhance or complicate the characters’ lives. If you aren’t ready for that sort
of thing to occur, keep the interaction as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say you should only roll for first impressions in moments of
import. We’re merely saying that outside of that, it’s best in small doses,
such as when you’re in a hurry and you just want to get past something
but let the player feel their skill mattered, but if you do it too much, then
the player will get (justifiably) annoyed as their skill is effectively thrown
back in their face, particularly if they haven’t made a strong investment in
Rapport.</p>
<p>It’s more useful to think of potential consequences down the line. Given
the same situation, the GM can just decide that when the players get to
the border and need to give their paperwork and convince the guards to
let them pass, they may be due for a +1 bonus if their papers were well
prepared or a -1 penalty if they weren’t. Just having the NPC comment on
the state of the papers when they make the roll at the border is enough of a
tip of the hat to the character who befriended or alienated the clerk to let
them feel their skill wasn’t wasted.</p>
<p>By focusing on potential consequences you can create a wonderful alchemy by
combining first impressions with NPCs, provided that the NPCs in question have
proven interesting to the players. Anytime an NPC proves interesting to your
players, it’s a good idea for you to think about bringing them back later on –
and what the first impressions the players made on that NPC will inform you
what sort of role that might be. A “bit-part” NPC left with a bad first
impression could easily turn into a minor rival or colorful (if petty) villain
down the road – and those with good impressions may inevitably end up in your
players’ growing stable of allies.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that a failure of Resolve should never take control

character carries himself, and how well or poorly he convinces everyone else
that he’s unfazed by events. If a character is exposed to something
disconcerting (like a fright), Resolve is useful to see how well they “keep it
together” and may impact whatever penalties the character is exposed to, but
how the character reacts, such as whether they run from the room, is a decision
the player makes. Such decisions can be influenced by aspects normally, but the
failure of the skill only removes control of the character when he is taken
out.</p>
<p>One good way to handle very stressful situations or other crises where keeping
your cool or otherwise keeping it together is paramount, is to use Resolve as a
modifier or restriction on whatever other skill the character is using, the
same way one would use Endurance to restrict skills when tired.</p>

<p>How much specific things cost is covered below, but there are a few things
to bear in mind when players start throwing money around.</p>
<p>Most importantly, be willing to be generous. Characters with a high Resources
skill <em>should</em> be throwing money around. That was the whole point of them
taking the skill. The important thing to remember is that money should be able
to remove obstacles, but it should not solve problems. A fat contribution to
the Mayor’s re-election campaign should get you an audience with him to plead
your case, but it should not get him to solve your problem for you (unless he’s
fantastically corrupt).</p>
<p>When a character is in a place where they can’t draw upon their usual
resources, you may increase the difficulty of making a purchase – anywhere from
+1 for a modest amount of red tape, to a +4 if they’re limited solely to the
already-converted local currency they happen to have in their pockets.  This
boost to difficulty needn’t indicate an increase in the actual cost of the
purchase; it is more likely to represent the increased effort necessary to make
the purchase happen.</p>

<p>Science is the backbone of pulp, so this is a fairly common skill, and it
shares a lot with Academics in terms of how it is used in play.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id817" id="id107" name="id107">◉ Lab Work [Science]</a></h4>
<p>This is the Science equivalent of Academics research (page XX), using a lab
rather than a library. Labs come in varying qualities, much like libraries do,
and the availability of a lab is one of the main limitations on lab work. At
the risk of sounding like a broken record, Lab Work is like any other effort to
get information – base difficulty should be low, with details provided by a
greater number of shifts, and the information found should be something that
can be acted upon unless it is specifically supposed to be frustrating.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id818" id="id108" name="id108">◉ Medical Attention [Science]</a></h4>
<p>When using Science as first aid in the middle of a fight, the character must
take a full action with a target who’s not trying to do anything else active
(i.e., forfeiting his next action). Make a roll against a target of Mediocre;
if it succeeds with at least one shift, the subject may remove a checkmark in
his one-stress box on his physical stress track. Every two shifts beyond the
first improves this effect by one; for example, with five shifts, a character
can remove a checkmark in his target’s three-stress box. Success can also be
used to “stabilize” someone who has taken a severe or lesser consequence that
would appear to be life-threatening (e.g., a Bleeding to Death aspect) – in
game terms, this has the effect of limiting the extent to which the aspect can
be compelled. A given person can’t be the target of more than one first aid
action in an exchange.</p>
<p>When using Science to address someone’s long-term injuries, the character must
spend a scene providing proper medical attention. This is a use of Science to
directly address someone’s physical, long-term consequences.  If the roll is
successful, then the time it takes the subject to recover from the consequence
is reduced by one step on the time table. Multiple such attempts may not be
made.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the roll depends on the severity of the consequence; starting
at moderate, the difficulty increases by two steps for each level of severity:</p>

<p>One common pickpocket technique that players may try is the “bump and grab”,
where an accomplice distracts the target, usually by bumping into them, so they
are less likely to notice the pickpocketing attempt.</p>
<p>If the player has an accomplice, the accomplice rolls a quick contest of Deceit
or Sleight of Hand against the target’s Alertness. If successful, they’ve
distracted the target, and the target doesn’t get the +2 bonus to their
Alertness as mentioned on page XX. Without an accomplice, a player is already
presumed to be doing as good a job at distracting the target as he can.</p>

<p>Stealth really depends on conditions. First and foremost, if someone is
actively watching the character, there’s no way to start sneaking. Beyond that,
Stealth is greatly affected by the environment.</p>

<p>If you’re not certain how to handle something, treat it as a half step. For
example, if a ninja is hiding in the dark (+2), but the guards have
flashlights, reduce the bonus to only +1. Also note, these are all matters of
visibility. Extreme noise can grant an extra +1, while total silence might
impose an additional -1 penalty.</p>
<p>Stealth is usually a quick contest between Stealth and Alertness, though anyone
who is “on alert” gains a +2 to their Alertness (as if they were making a full
defense). Usually, Investigation isn’t in use because there’s no active
searching effort. Simply being on guard does not equate to being on alert –
there must be some reason for a heightened sense of alert, and it can only be
sustained for so long before boredom sets in again.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id823" id="id113" name="id113">◉ Hiding [Stealth]</a></h4>
<p>If someone is actively searching for a hidden character, they use Investigation
rather than Alertness and gain a +2 on the roll so long as they have some
reason to actually be looking and are taking the time to do a thorough search
in the right place. When someone is searching you can usually assume they’ll do
logical things like turn on the lights or otherwise do things to put penalties
on any attempt to hide. The +2 is not available without reason or time, and
lacking both will often set things back in the realm of Alertness.</p>
<p>This means that if a stealthy character is ever in a position where people are
actively searching for him, he’s in a lot of trouble. That usually requires
that the character was spotted or somehow set off an alarm – which, if he’s
doing his job, he wasn’t, and didn’t.</p>
<p>For example, consider a character hiding in a storeroom. If a guard opens the
door, shines a flashlight in, and looks around, it’s just a quick Investigation
roll (reason, perhaps, but not time), and the character can probably stay
hidden. If the guard flips on the lights and starts methodically going through
the room, hiding is much, much more difficult – he’s imposed some penalties,
and he has both reason and time.</p>
<p>The good news is that this sort of searching is usually obvious, so when the
guard flips on the lights and starts looking, it’s the player’s cue to act now
or give up his chance at surprise.</p>

<p>When a character tries to move while remaining unseen, anyone looking for him gains a +2 bonus for each zone he moves. Within a conflict, normally, moving at more than a cautious creep or a walk will automatically break stealth, so this is usually limited to a one-zone move. As a rule of thumb outside of conflict, observers are at +2 for a cautious creep, +4 for walking pace, +6 for a jog and +8 to run.</p>

<p>(Skill, page XX;Stunts, page XX)</p>
<p>Survival is a very broad skill covering virtually every sort of outdoorsy
activity from wilderness survival to animal handling. As a general rule, if it
seems like something man was doing before that pesky technology came along,
there’s a better than even chance that Survival’s the skill to roll.</p>

<p>Animals are dumb. This is an important thing to remember when dealing
with them.</p>
<p>Most animals will act in a specific way in any given situation. How an animal
responds to a person is very much like a first impression (see Rapport). If the
animal has been trained, like an attack dog, then not much is going to change
it’s mind, but if it really could go either way, Survival can be rolled against
the creature’s Resolve to see if the impression is favorable or unfavorable. If
the animal is potentially hostile, a friendly result means it’s not likely to
attack. If the animal is potentially useful (such as with riding), a friendly
roll is necessary to get it to work.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id827" id="id116" name="id116">◉ Scavenging [Survival]</a></h4>
<p>The difficulty for finding something is based off how likely it is to be found
and how interesting it will be to use. The base likelihood depends on the
environment and what’s being looked for. If it makes sense that it could be
there (like wood and vine in a forest) then the difficulty is Mediocre. If it’s
a bit of a stretch, but still possible (decent wood in a swamp) then the
default is Good, and if it’s less likely or simply outright rare, it’s Superb
or higher.</p>
<p>Each qualifying criteria increases the difficulty by 1. Thus, if a character
needs sticks in a forest, the difficulty is Mediocre, but if he needs sticks of
a certain size and strength (2 criteria) the difficulty is Mediocre +2 (Fair).
If the character is trying to build something, like a trap, it’s an Engineering
roll, modified by Survival.</p>

<p>First and foremost, remember that the ability to throw things is the main
mechanical balance for the Weapons skill versus the Fists skill. The Weapons
skill bridges the gap between Fists and Guns as a combat skill. Provided an
actual weapon is in hand, the Weapons skill may be used to attack – and some
weapons will either be thrown (like a knife) or have an unusually long reach
(like a whip), allowing the attack to reach into an adjacent zone – as well as
to defend. The downside, simply, is that the skill requires the use of a weapon
– someone who successfully disarms a character using Weapons has effectively
deprived him of using this skill.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage a Fists user faces against a Weapons user is the
ability of the weapons user to make use of this additional reach, and the GM is
encouraged to be generous when allowing a Weapons user to make maneuvers that
take advantage of this. At the same time, the advice under Fists (see page XX)
about mismatched weapons remains valid – a weapon does not in and of itself
grant a bonus, but it does shape the way a fight is described.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id831" id="explosions" name="explosions">8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explosions</a></h3>
<p>Explosions and other area attacks have the potential to do damage against
everyone within their radius. They are deadly and can end a fight or alter
a scenario significantly once used. Choose very carefully before allowing
free and easy use of explosives in your game.</p>
<p>As discussed briefly on page XX, explosives have three ratings: complexity,
area, and force. Here, we’ll dig deeper into what these mean.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong> is the difficulty to disarm the bomb once the fuse has been lit
or the pin has been pulled.</p>
<p>The <strong>area</strong> of an explosion determines how many zones the explosion will
cover. An area of 1 means the explosion affects only one zone. An area of 2
means it affects one zone and <strong>every zone adjacent to it</strong>. And area of 3
expands it out to all zones adjacent to that. An area of 10 can pretty
effectively cover a small town, and a 20 can cover a large city. This of course
assumes that your zones are roughly the same size, that the explosion
originates in the center of its zone, and so forth – feel free to tweak how
things behave. There’s nothing saying some area 2 explosions don’t hit all of
their adjacent zones, merely that they <em>could</em>.</p>
<p>The force of an explosion is a measure of how dangerous it is once it finally
detonates. When an explosive detonates in a zone that a character is in, the
force value is the difficulty of the free action Athletics test to take cover
behind something solid. People unaware that a detonation is impending
automatically fail this roll. If successful, the character takes a consequence
(unless he generates some spin, in which case he makes a miraculous escape). If
he fails, he is taken out immediately and is either badly injured or dead
(though only minions should outright die in explosions).</p>
<p>The good news is that the force of an explosion drops by one for each zone it
crosses, so characters in an adjacent zone have to deal with a force level
that’s 1 lower. If there is a border between the zones that would provide some
cover (like a wall) it also reduces force by the value of the border.  The
force of an explosion drops to zero once it reaches its maximum radius
indicated by the area.</p>
<p>In case that doesn’t make it perfectly clear, the use of explosives in a fight
is extremely, perhaps even insanely dangerous, but extremely potent. Setting
and using explosives can usually be done using the Engineering skill, but
throwing a stick of dynamite into a fight is something else entirely. Fuses are
not your friend. Before a character throws, the GM should ask if the fuse is
short, medium or long (for some explosives this is fixed, and not a choice of
the player’s). This does not literally need to mean a physical fuse – it could
just as easily be a timer or some other control. If the explosive supposed to
go off on impact, it will need a hair trigger (see page XX in Gadgets and
Gizmos).</p>
<p>Throwing an explosive as an attack works in two stages. When a character throws
an explosive, it’s an attack using Weapons against a difficulty of Mediocre. If
successful, the explosive lands in an appropriate zone (remember that thrown
weapons have a range of one zone), and if not, it lands in the thrower’s zone.</p>
<p>When the explosive lands, everyone within a zone covered by its area rolls
Athletics against the attacker’s Weapons result (from above) to get clear,
should they so wish; if they gain spin on this defense roll, they may move one
zone away from the zone the explosive is in by “diving clear” as a free action.
Anything short of spin has no effect – they’ll have to hope that they get a
turn before it goes off or, otherwise deal with a detonation scenario as
described above. The thrower has the option to reduce everyone’s difficulty to
dive clear (he may not want to make it too difficult for his allies to dive
away), so long as that difficulty is not reduced below Mediocre.  If the
thrower makes a bad throw – missing the Mediocre target entirely – then as
noted, the explosive lands in the thrower’s zone, with the difficulty for the
thrower to dive free increased by one for each step he missed the target. The
thrower does not have the option to reduce it, though in such a circumstance
everyone else merely faces a Mediocre difficulty to dive clear.</p>
<p>After this initial “dive clear” check, the GM makes a quick check before
every individual action to see if the bomb explodes, by rolling 2 dice:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="22%">
<col width="23%">
<col width="25%">
<col width="30%">

<tr><td>-1</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>-2</td>
<td>Fizzle</td>
<td>Fizzle</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On a fizzle result, make a mark on a piece of paper. The next time a fizzle
result comes up, if a mark’s already been made, the bomb is a dud or otherwise
unable to explode. If the GM chooses to make it an option, characters with
appropriate aspects may invoke them to demand that GM re-roll the dice after
revealing the result.</p>
<p>Each time the turn comes around to the person who lit the fuse again, a full
exchange has passed, and the fuse’s length drops by one step – so if a
long-fuse explosive is out there for a full exchange, it becomes a medium fuse
explosive, and so on. If it’s a short fuse explosive (pretty improbable that it
lasted a full exchange), then it goes off right then and there.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id832" id="playing-with-fire" name="playing-with-fire">Playing With Fire</a></h4>
<p>When a character has an unexploded bomb in his zone and the opportunity to act,
he may try a few things.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Pick It Up and Throw It.</dt>
<dd>This uses the same rules for throwing the explosive that the original thrower
used, but at a -1 penalty for taking the supplemental action of picking it
up. This can become a deadly game of hot potato, and not one you want to get
into with a character who has the Catch stunt (see page XX).</dd>
<dt>Pick It Up and Disarm It.</dt>
<dd>A character may use his own Engineering to disarm a bomb. This action is at
-1 for the supplemental action of picking it up and is at a difficulty equal
to the complexity of the explosive. It’s easy to pull the fuse out of a stick
of dynamite, but somewhat harder to stop a grenade without the pin.</dd>
<dt>Leap on Top of It.</dt>
<dd>Well, first off, this will pretty much kill the character dead. That said, it
will improve the chances of everyone around him by reducing the force of the
explosion by 3. If the character is armored in some way, then the value of
the armor is also subtracted from the force.  Under particularly unusual
circumstances, sets of stunts, or strange arcane invulnerability rituals, the
character might be able to walk away from this, but really, players should be
discouraged from such actions unless they’re looking to start a new
character. Fate points could be brought to bear, of course, to force a fizzle
once this is done, but the GM should feel quite free to charge the player
every single fate point he has to pull it off (sort of like the Death
Defiance stunt, page XX, only temporary, and with more bite).</dd>
<dt>Run Away.</dt>
<dd>Often the wisest course, using Athletics to sprint away from the bomb is not
such a bad idea. The trick is that you need a chance to take a turn to be
able to exercise this option. Players are often going to want to bring their
friends along on their flight away from the scene of a bomb, so GMs should
make sure to review the rules on throwing, pushing, and carrying (page XX).
While an individual will most always get away faster, the nature of a fuse –
getting checked on every action – may make a player prefer to get less
distance, if he’s helping a slower person get some distance too.</dd>

<p>When a character encounters a bomb in a situation other than having it
thrown by a maniac, there are a few commonalities to expect. It is usually
larger, heavier and more powerful, and it usually has an explicit trigger,
such as a timer on a countdown or an event it will trigger in response to,
like a tripwire.</p>
<p>Such bombs are inevitably powerful enough that characters in close proximity to
them when they detonate have very little chance of survival. Thankfully, the
role of such bombs is not to blow up but rather, to threaten to blow up.
Usually such bombs are in important places so that if they go off, there will
be serious consequences, even if the characters are unharmed.</p>
<p>Attempts to disarm one of these bombs will require one or more Engineering
rolls against its complexity. A failure on any roll shouldn’t result in the
bomb exploding immediately; instead turn the bomb into one with a fuse that
starts counting down! Roll a single die: minus means it’s become a short fuse,
blank means a medium, and plus a long. Hopefully, this buys time enough for
everyone to run like the dickens. More information on handling situations like
this can be found under “Death Traps and Other Dooms” on page XX.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter, we presented ideas for how to make use of the nuts and
bolts of the system itself in order to get the best effect. But that’s only
part of the GMing job. Here, we talk about the art of GMing – and more

advancement, important “configuration” decisions about your setting, and camera
work. Read on!</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id835" id="the-power-of-the-pickup-game" name="the-power-of-the-pickup-game">9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Power of the Pickup Game</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you have everything you need for a game. The session is planned.  The
players are all on time. Snacks are on hand. You’re good to go.  It’s a nice
thought, isn’t it? Unfortunately, reality doesn’t always comply.  Life comes up
and one player or another can’t make it. A babysitter doesn’t show. Family
visits from out of town. There’s a work emergency. Reasonable problems, and
understandable, but frustrating all the same. You can always just cancel the
game, but that’s rarely satisfying for anyone.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is the pickup game, a game played with whoever is
on hand, purely for the fun of it. Pickup games can be tough, because it’s not
easy to create an entire adventure on the kind of short notice we’re talking
about. It can be even more time consuming to come up with characters and get
everything started up.</p>
<p>SotC is written with the pickup game in mind. Certainly, you can run a
satisfying campaign in the traditional vein, but even if you do, the elements
that make up a pickup game can be useful when players bail, or when you find
yourself pressed for time to prepare a session on short notice.</p>
<p>There is one central principle of the pickup game: ease of use. It needs to
be easy to prepare, easy to get started, and easy to play. Ease means two
things: that it’s quick, and it’s simple. Pickup games don’t have a lot of
ramp up time, so speed is of the essence, and since they’re intermittent, you
don’t want players needing to relearn an entire system every time they play,
so complexity is problematic. It also means that you want to be able to just
start playing: long introductions, extended shopping trips, foreshadowing
and other tricks that take time now for a payoff later have no place in the
pickup game. Make it cool, and make it cool <em>right now</em>. To that end, we
offer three different means of planning a game: Structured, Aspected, and
Dynamic.</p>

<p>The characters are the period’s equivalent of jet setters. If there’s something
interesting going on in the world, there’s a good chance there’s at least one
PC there. With that in mind, there is no pussyfooting around required to
explain why the characters are on the scene – they should be there, so they
are!</p>
<p>Once you’ve got the ball rolling, the next big advantage for a pickup game is
the spirit of pulp. It’s a spirit of action. If players aren’t willing to be
proactive, then someone has not communicated or understood how this game is
supposed to work. What’s more, pulp plots are simply not that sophisticated, so
it’s easy for players to jump headfirst into them. Perhaps even more
importantly, it makes them easy for GMs to come up with.  With that general
idea of what you’re going to want for a pickup game, let’s take a moment to
break down the specific steps.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id837" id="establishing-characters" name="establishing-characters">Establishing Characters</a></h4>
<p>While you can use the on-the-fly character creation rules (page XX), that’s not
necessarily the best solution. If your game schedule is erratic enough that you
expect to be running pickup games with any frequency, it may be useful to do
character creation in advance. Having an established character to step into can
help players get going quickly when the pickup game begins. A fast creation
character will eventually have the same utility, but can make the first few
sessions a little rough.</p>
<p>There’s also some incentive for the GM to encourage players to establish their
characters in advance of a session – it makes plotting up the session easier.
Established characters have aspects and histories that the GM can (and should!)
mine for inspiration.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id838" id="the-pulp-plot-framework" name="the-pulp-plot-framework">The Pulp Plot Framework</a></h4>
<p>Here’s a secret – once you hit your stride with pulp, all you’re going to need
to come up with is an adventure title. But that will come with practice.
There’s advice for running adventures elsewhere in this book which will be
helpful to you, but some of it may take some getting used to. Until you’re
at a comfort level that allows a little more improvisation, you’re going to
want to start with a pretty structured model, and that’s what we’re offering
you here. Once you have the bones of the structure in place, you can start
elaborating on it to suit your needs, but if you ever get stumped, just come
back to this simple model.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Endanger the Characters</li>
<li>Reveal the True Danger</li>
<li>The Pursuit Encounters Complications</li>
<li>Certain Doom</li>
<li>The Twist</li>
<li>Final Showdown</li>
<li>Breakneck Escape (Optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, this is not the model for <em>every</em> pulp plot. Rather, it is a structure
to follow in creating plots until you want to discard it. You also are not
obliged to determine the components of the outline in any particular order.
Find something that interests you, put it in the appropriate slot, and then
fill in the other slots to better justify it. If you have a really cool
deathtrap you want to throw the characters into, go ahead and put it in as
Certain Doom, then figure out the rest so the deathtrap makes sense. If you’re
at a loss for where to begin, start with the Final Showdown. It’s going to be
the most dramatic element of the game, and what villains and elements it
includes may suggest how to handle some of the earlier elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id839" id="endanger-the-characters" name="endanger-the-characters">Endanger the Characters</a></h4>
<p>It may seem odd that the first thing is figuring out how to threaten the
characters. Intuitively, it might seem more reasonable to figure out where the
game opens. As it happens, these are one and the same thing. Figuring out how
you’re going to endanger the characters contains a large component that depends
on where they’re going to be. Environmental hazards require certain settings,
as do burglaries or wars. The nature of the danger will suggest the setting.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the nature of the danger can vary greatly. The most basic
sort of danger is an unexpected attack. This is usually performed by a mob of
low-quality, highly distinctive minions of the villain, sometimes led by a
lieutenant of some sort. The goal of the attack can vary greatly.  They might
be after the characters, they might be after someone else at the location, they
could be there to steal or destroy something; they might even be there by
accident. In determining why they’re there, you put the first piece into place
regarding the plot.</p>
<p>Alternately, the danger might be environmental: a ship sinking, a zeppelin
going down, a building on fire or collapsing in an earthquake. Any of these
is a suitable threat to get things going. Sometimes there is a motive behind
the danger, like someone setting the building on fire, and sometimes it’s
just bad timing. The cause is important to determine, if only for what it
implies. A ship sinking because it’s been sabotaged means that the danger
is the saboteur. A ship sinking due to an accident is usually a precursor to
washing up on a dangerous uncharted island.
It’s also possible to mix and match dangers. A building with a bomb in
it requires evacuation as well as discovering and disarming the bomb or
bombs.
Whatever the danger, it is important that it is a legitimate threat, and that
the characters can address it in some way. Even if they can’t stop it entirely,
they shouldn’t be helpless bystanders – they can save civilians, keep thieves
from taking all the treasures of the Louvre, or keep the ship from crashing
on the rocks, killing everyone on board. Go into the game assuming that
players will drastically impact the flow of events, and plan anything you
feel needs to happen around that assumption.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause of the previous danger, it was only a taste of things to
come. This is the opportunity for characters with strong investigative talents
to shine, as they discover the pieces of the puzzle, revealing at least part of
why things are in trouble, and where to go next. This step requires two
important things – an explanation, and a clue. The explanation does not need to
be complete. It may be known that the villains are up to something involving
the Eye of Askaton, but that doesn’t mean that anyone knows precisely what.</p>
<p>The clue should point to a place. It may be that it points to a person in that
place, or a thing in the place, but it should draw a clear line towards where
the characters should go next. It should also suggest that time is of the
essence, so there is strong impetus to get moving.</p>

<p>The players should have a clear sense of what they need to do at this point.  They should have a clear direction which they are able to move decisively towards. And this is the point where things go terribly wrong. Maybe another group reveals itself with an attack. Maybe the apparently simple explanation of events is revealed to be deception.</p>
<p>Generally, either something about the pursuit creates a complication, such as an obstacle to bypass, or something external threatens the journey, such as an attack or a disaster. If this sounds a lot like Endangering the Characters, there’s a reason for it. In fact, if the Endangering step was an attack, then the complication should be something environmental or other wise difficult to overcome. If the Endangering was environmental, then an attack might be appropriate. Basically, your goal here is to provide a different type of challenge, to allow different characters to shine.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to complicate the plot. If there’s some other element you want to include, now’s your chance. Some traditional complications include new characters on the scene, such as new villains, old enemies, or even rivals pursuing the same goal. Others include a double cross by friendly guides, a loss of supplies or equipment, or another problem demanding attention that conflicts with the issue at hand, leading the characters to a tough decision.</p>
<p>If the complication turns the current course of action into a dead end, it’s important that another action option suggests itself (after a suitable period of dramatic tension). Of course, that course of action may well pass through Certain Doom (see below).</p>

<p>Sometimes the complication gets worse, or it leads to another situation, or
sometimes another situation entirely comes up. One way or another, the
characters end up in a terrible situation, where it seems absolutely certain
that the characters will perish. The classic example of this is the fiendish
deathtrap, but it can really be anything that looks like certain doom. The
whole point is to ratchet up the tension, get things to the point where it
looks like there’s no hope, and put the players on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Then you go get a drink.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe not, but it’s kind of fun. You really do want to make the players
sweat, so this is certainly time for a dramatic pause at the very least before
they start desperately throwing around crazy plans and ideas for getting out.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id847" id="the-twist" name="the-twist">The Twist</a></h4>
<p>The twist is a revelation that changes the understanding of the situation.  The
delivery of the twist can come in many forms. It can be simple information from
a captured foe, released prisoner or even a gloating villain.  Often, it flows
from actions, like the arrival of an unexpected ally providing aid and
information, or a villain’s henchman turning against him at an opportune
moment.</p>
<p>One bit of secret utility for the twist is that it can get you, the GM, out of
trouble. If your Certain Doom is looking a little too certain, or if there’s an
element of the story that got missed, now is your time to throw it in. And,
frankly, if you discover things have gone too far off the tracks, this is your
opportunity to say “Ha-ha, it was all a trick. This is what’s actually going
on!” Obviously this is a power to use sparingly, lest your players become
skeptical of every plot, but it can really save you when the need arises.</p>
<p>The “twist” doesn’t need to be too much of a twist. Its real role is a
revelation, the final piece of the puzzle which makes the path to the final
showdown crystal clear.</p>
<p>This should also be the point where the clock starts ticking. If the twist lets
the players know what the villain’s master plan is, but also leaves them
feeling that they’ve got all the time in the world to deal with it, it will
kill all the tension and turn into an extended shopping trip and planning
session (which, we’ll remind you, are boring and have no place in a pickup
game).  As such, it is an important part of the revelation that time is running
out.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id849" id="final-showdown" name="final-showdown">Final Showdown</a></h4>
<p>There are a lot of ways to run the climactic fight scene, but there always
needs to be something that sets it apart from just a normal fight scene.  This
may be some environmental element, something distinctive about the opposition,
or almost anything else, all with the underlying tension of what happens if the
players fail.</p>
<p>And there’s the real kicker – in any other fight, there is a simple tension
tied to the character’s health, but the stakes are higher in the climax. If
they lose, something specific and bad is going to happen, and it’s going to be
all their fault. No pressure though.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you don’t want the terrible thing to be the end of the
world unless you’re very confident in your players. Failure is not something we
want to see happen, but most failures have the option of creating future
adventures. If the Giant Robot is activated despite the heroes’ efforts, then
it means that at some point there will be an adventure to stop the rampaging
giant robot. When you destroy the world, it’s kind of hard to go anywhere from
there (unless you want to take the cheap Hollywood out of temporarily being
able to rewind time!).</p>
<p>With the consequences in mind, it’s time to get the ball rolling. Now, it’s
possible that the final showdown is some other sort of contest, like a race. If
so, the tension is usually coming from the stakes. The only drawback with doing
something other than a fight scene is that since this is the climax, everyone
should have something to do, and more specialized scenes rarely allow this.</p>
<p>To spice up the fight it’s time to look at your characters. At least a few of
the opponents should be suited to the player’s area of expertise. If you have a
big, strong character, consider a big, strong opponent; if you have a flying
character, consider a flying opponent; and so on.</p>
<p>The tricky part of this is that you don’t want to do that for every character
all the time – otherwise it feels like Battle of the Doppelgangers. The best
thing to do is look at the big challenge of the scene and figure which
characters are most capable of handling it, and then come up for dance partners
for the people you feel will be a bit left out.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of a trick: come up with a few more detailed opponents than
you’ll need. When you see how the fight is going, you can note which characters
are at loose ends and zero in on them.</p>
<p>There are a few other tricks and traps to be aware of.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you have a big main villain, make sure he’s not left in a situation
where all the players can gang up on him, since he’ll go down too fast.
Give him minions, mobility or some other advantage that can be picked away
at, so that he feels like a more substantial challenge.</li>
<li>Use the environment to kill off NPCs you don’t want to track any more. If
the characters nail a guy hard enough that one more hit will drop him,
rather than just keep him around for bookkeeping purposes, have him be the
guy who falls into the lava or is eaten by the pursuing monster. It
emphasizes the dangers of the environment and saves you headaches. It also
establishes precedent for when the main villain takes a similar plunge
later.</li>
<li>Try not to kill any important character, be they PC or NPC, onscreen.
Characters coming back from certain doom is a staple of pulp, so such
questionable deaths are to be expected.</li>
<li>Whatever reason required the players to get to the showdown in a hurry can
still be in effect. Adding a countdown happening during an existing fight
can ratchet up the tension drastically.  However, it can also trap you.
The last thing you want is a literal countdown, since the numbers are a
fixed effect. Instead you want to have physical cues that indicate that
things are getting worse.  Waters rise, ancient statues begin to move and
so on. These sorts of cues allow the GM to dramatically indicate things
are getting worse, but without nailing yourself to a specific timeframe.</li>

<p>Not every game will include a breakneck escape. Traditionally, it’s that flight
for life as the enemy’s headquarters blow up behind you or the volcano erupts.
How necessary it is for the story has a lot to do with how exciting the climax
was. If everyone clearly had a good time with the climax, then the escape can
pretty much get hand-waved. If there’s a little more excitement to be squeezed
out of the evening, then some attention should be spent on the escape.</p>
<p>A good, convincing escape can be hard to run, simply because this is a stupid
place to kill a character. Instead, you need to put something else at risk, so
there is a possibility of loss without killing off a character. Escape should
be dangerous, but the real danger should be to the thing or person they are
taking with them.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished the session, wrap up should be brief, but should make it
clear that the characters’ heroism is appreciated and that they made a real
difference. The rewards of pulp are not in treasure or money, but it’s not
purely in the moral satisfaction either. Not every adventure ends in accolades,
but if it’s appropriate, make sure that the characters get recognized for their
deeds.</p>

<p>Long as that explanation was, it’s an easy model to apply. Just a line or two
of notes for each element are enough to form the basic framework. And remember,
just as you can have the player characters created on the fly, you can have
your villains created on the fly, too – just write down a few salient points
and don’t sweat the details until you need them.</p>

<p>Having this sort of structure easily on hand is a useful tool. But it can also
be a boat anchor around your neck. A planned plot is only useful so far as you
can get the players to buy into it. Continuing to stick to a plot after it’s
gone off the rails can lead to a host of problems, not the least of which are
frustration and boredom.</p>
<p>Structured plots are a good place to start… But to really shine, you’ve got to
learn the skills of guided improvisation. And that is where our next method
comes in.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id856" id="the-aspected-pickup-game-improvising-like-a-pro" name="the-aspected-pickup-game-improvising-like-a-pro">9.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aspected Pickup Game: Improvising Like a Pro</a></h3>
<p>So you only have about twenty minutes to prepare for the session, the pizza is
on the way, and you’re staring at the PC’s character sheets wondering what on
earth you’re going to do with tonight’s gaming. Suddenly, just before you’ve
resigned yourself to a place in GM Hell, an idea strikes – brilliant,
masterful, worthy of the greats. You structure it out and chart it quickly, jot
down major elements, bask in the glow of certainty, and wear that evil grin all
the way to the table when your players arrive.</p>
<p>Play happens. Suddenly, after an hour of the players just being there, the
structure of your plot is shot into so many pieces that you don’t recognize
what’s going on anymore. It apparently doesn’t matter that session you planned
is just that damn good – sometimes things just don’t fall your way.</p>
<p>When structure fails you, it can be useful to step back and think of the game
as the story of the characters. That seems simple enough, but consider the
implication: just like the protagonists of a book or movie, the most
interesting story is wherever <em>they</em> are, and is the story best suited to
<em>these</em> characters in particular.</p>
<p>Fortunately, your players have already given you tools to make it easy for
you to determine what needs to be important in an adventure, what they
want to see in the game, what to hang and hook conflicts around, and
what elements you can include to make them feel like the story belongs to
them.</p>
<p>These tools are called aspects. Your players put them on the character sheet
for a reason. Now it’s time for you to use them.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id857" id="basic-assumptions" name="basic-assumptions">Basic Assumptions</a></h4>
<p>This approach requires a few basic assumptions on your part as the GM, so
let’s get them out of the way now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is not necessary for you to know how anything is going to turn out for
you to run a good session, and in fact, better stories can (and often do)
result when you have no preconceived ideas in that regard.  This includes
the outcome of any conflict or decision the players make, what scene is
going to conclude the adventure, and everything in between. Cooperative
effort will be necessary to make the thing work.  That’s good.</li>
<li>The use of aspects, whether to invoke or compel, is one of the key methods
in this game to add “weight” to any decisions made, and is therefore one of
the key methods to create drama and tension during play.</li>
<li>The more that a given session of play involves moments where aspects are
invoked or compelled in response to or because of a decision, the more
inherently interesting it is. Play is boring when nothing is really at
stake.</li>
<li>Whatever the players are interested in is more important and better than
anything you came up with. If your ideas are so good that player input ruins
them, you should be writing novels instead of playing roleplaying games.</li>
<li>None of these principles should be applied in extremes. If you do have some
kind of great idea to throw into the adventure, you can probably work it in
so long as it doesn’t violate any of the basic tenets above.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id858" id="making-the-plot" name="making-the-plot">Making the Plot</a></h4>
<p>When you’re making an adventure up the aspected way, you’re not going to
be making up an entire plot. You may have a firm idea about how you want
to kick things off, but after that, you need to be prepared for the adventure
to branch off in any number of directions.</p>
<p>What you do need to do, however, is pick the aspects on each of the player’s sheets that you want to meaningfully incorporate into the adventure.</p>
<p>Usually, one or two per PC will more than suffice, though you may want to
pick more if you have a few solid days scheduled to play the pickup game.
These aspects, once you select them, are going to form the basis for your
adventure’s focus – they’ll determine what the central adventure seed is,
what types of decisions the players will have to make, and what context you
can draw from when you have to pull things out of your rear end.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. Suppose you have a two-person player group (we’ll
call their characters John and Jane), and one aspect from each of them
really catches your eye: John has an aspect of Loyal Like a Dog, and Jane
has an aspect of Keeps Her Past a Secret (keep in mind that as the GM,
you’ll know what that past is from character creation). An adventure that
revolves around these two aspects might do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a situation where John’s loyalty is not necessarily the best way to
solve a problem, or one where in order to accomplish something important, he
may have to betray one of his friends.</li>
<li>Create a situation in which revealing something of Jane’s past is the key to
resolving a problem without severe consequences, and she has to choose
whether or not her secrets are more important than suffering those
consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about that for a moment, you get an idea for an adventure seed: A
former partner of Jane’s in a shady business dealing from her past is using the
finances gained from it to fund the robotics research of a mad scientist, so
that he can use the robotic creations to hold Washington D .C. for ransom. If
he isn’t stopped from buying the last few components the scientist needs and
isn’t exposed to the law, he will create a reign of terror that will paralyze
the whole country.</p>
<p>Obviously this presents an issue for Jane – she could come forward and testify
to what she knows about her former partner directly, but the proof would reveal
her participation as well, damage her reputation, possibly cost her friends,
get her in potential legal trouble, and give her enemies leverage over her.</p>
<p>How do we work this into an issue for John? Simple enough – if someone John
trusts is investigating the situation, he may ask John to look into Jane’s
potential involvement in the matter. If Jane knows about this investigation,
obviously she could cover it up however she wants, so discretion becomes
paramount. Suddenly, issues for John come up to the fore. Does his loyalty for
his friend Jane outweigh his devotion to justice? If he does find evidence
implicating her, will his loyalty allow him to use her to stop what’s going on?</p>
<p>Between resolving these issues and whatever other confrontations occur between
the villains and the PC’s, you’ve definitely got enough material here for a
four-hour session.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id859" id="decision-points" name="decision-points">Decision Points</a></h4>
<p>So, now you know the core of the adventure. What’s next? You still don’t have any idea what’s actually going to happen in the course of play, and you’ve only got ten minutes to go before your house will be filled with wily, structure-killing gamers (gotta love ’em). The next step is to take the elements you thought up and structure them into decision points. These points will focus around an open-ended choice that can’t be ignored and will push the action in a certain direction (for those familiar with Ron Edwards’ Sorcerer, these are, indeed, “bangs”). The decision points should make use of the seed material. Be sure to keep most of them flexible enough that they could be introduced into the adventure at any time, and don’t predetermine any outcomes.</p>
<p>Going back to our example, we can immediately see some decision points
that need to happen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At some point, the true identity of the bad guy ( Jane’s partner) will
have to be revealed, probably as the crux of the adventure, leaving Jane
stuck with the choice of how to deal with it. This might best be
accomplished through a clandestine meeting where he taunts her, warning
her to stay out of his way unless she wants to bring herself down too.</li>
<li>At some point, another investigative party (like an informant, cop, or
contact) will inform John of their suspicions regarding Jane, pressing
the urgency of the situation upon him, and ask him to snoop on her
secretly. John will have to decide whether he’s going to do that or not,
if he’s going to tell Jane, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two decision points alone will spin off into a potential group of
scenes. If John goes straight to Jane, they may decide to work together to
root out what the precise connection is to Jane’s past and reveal the villain
that way. If they choose to keep secrets from each other, there will be a
little cat and mouse as John tries to get Jane away from her house and office
long enough to snoop. That other investigative party might provide some
harassment for Jane as he pursues his own motives. Jane might try and find
a way to alter the evidence that links her to the villain. Lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But it may not be enough. Here are some more, off the top of your genius
head:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Robots descend into the street when the characters are present, unstable prototypes of the mad scientist. They get involved in a brawl with local cops and start wreaking havoc. Do the characters intervene? The cops will probably be able to handle it themselves, and it’d keep them in a low profile, but some people could die and the cops would likely take away all the evidence of the attack. If the characters fight the robots directly, they could potentially get in trouble for any collateral damage, and it would inform the villain that the characters are in town. This is the kind of scene that’s great to open an adventure.</li>
<li>The characters discover that the research company that the mad scientist is getting technical equipment from is also involved in humanitarian efforts, providing certain important pharmaceuticals to hospitals in need. If an NPC is involved in helping them get this info, he or she will beg the characters not to make the company’s involvement public, claiming that there was no way the company could know better. Can the characters afford to implicate the company if it means that they could get shut down? Can they risk being caught if they selectively alter the evidence? Is that justice?</li>
<li>The villain offers to demand something of great value to a PC (perhaps relevant to another aspect) as part of his ransom, and he genuinely doesn’t want to see what the full potential of the robots are – he’s just a businessman, and he wants his money. He is genuine about his offer, and will accede to demands from the characters if they leave him and his ransom demand alone. The mad scientist may have other plans, so it’ll still come to a showdown, but it gives the player a chance to decide whether or not his character really does have a price…</li>
</ul>

<p>So there it is – all the material you need for a successful night’s adventuring.  Start with a bang-up opening scene, get into a decision point, and run whatever scenes are necessary to explore the consequences of the choices made. Mix more decision points in whenever you need to and continue riffing off of them, and you’re guaranteed at least a whole evening of play.  Even better, because those scenes all rebound off decisions the PC’s have made, the episode will definitively be “about” them in a way that no preplotted adventure structure can be, even at its most flexible. Because you have nothing predetermined, the outcomes will surprise and entertain you, and the stories will be full of unexpected character development and thematic weight.</p>

<p>So this is all well and good, but how do introduce new decision points into play? If you’re chaining a whole group of scenes off of one decision, do you need to introduce more if there’s a good momentum going?</p>
<p>Emphatically, <em>no you don’t</em>. Don’t get married to the idea of including
everything you’ve come up with in the session – a lot of decision points you
come up with may be rendered irrelevant by the action of play or simply
be extraneous in the middle of all the action you have going on. Often,
with a proactive group, you may only need one or two major decisions per
character to fill the night with scenes.</p>
<p>In the end, pulp is about action. If you have action going on, roll with it!  But, if the pace starts to flag or the events of the first decision point resolve more quickly than you expected, introduce a new one. The easiest way to do this is through NPCs – no matter what, people will always respond to people better than they’ll respond to other stimuli. People the character is connected to, with a strong need and the will to pursue that need, are often all you require to push decision points. What if a PC has a rivalry with a cop on the scene when the robots attack? What if the person who wants to spare the research company is a doctor friend of a PC? What if the villain was in love with Jane back then?</p>
<p>It also might help you to restructure more traditional adventure scene goals (break in here, defeat these guards, make this investigation roll, etc .) to be the beginning for a decision point scene instead of the end. Instead of spending all your time trying to figure out if the characters are going to get their hands on the smoking gun, drop it in their laps with one bullet left in it and a villain who just torched their friends/lovers/parents/children.  Justice or vengeance?</p>
<p>That’s the kind of pressure that will get you stories.</p>
</div>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id862" id="avoid-dithering-with-pacing-and-structure" name="avoid-dithering-with-pacing-and-structure">Avoid Dithering with Pacing and Structure</a></h4>
<p>Often, going with this method will require you to be very flexible with overall plot structure, as reacting to decisions may not net you an adventure in the traditional “beginning-middle-end” format. But you know what? That’s okay, as long as everyone’s having a good time. On the other hand, you don’t want to create a situation where scenes get muddled from one to the next and the pace drags on because of a lack of proactivity. This is pulp, for God’s sake. Things have to keep happening. Do not let your session dither. If you’ve only got four hours on a Tuesday night to play and you’re still unraveling initial plot complications during the third hour, you’re probably going too slowly. Take the dulled wits and bleary nods from your players as a sign.</p>
<p>Remember, as the GM, you are in complete control of when scenes transition from one to the next, what the actual decisions are that have to be made, and how much pressure gets applied by NPCs or in-game situation to move things along. You’re still in control of a lot, and like a smart movie editor, you need to know how to frame scenes, which is talked about in more detail later in this chapter (see page XX).</p>
<p>Luckily, a lot of the basics of scene framing happen by instinct – people have a tendency to subconsciously structure things, and the general anatomy of a story is something practically hardwired into our brains by now. When things start to bog down, though, it’s your job to kick your game into gear.  Your power to frame scenes is paramount to establishing pace (see page XX for more).</p>
<p>For this reason, the adventure structure provided earlier can still be useful to you in this method. Taken as a general example of how stories go, it can give you a good hint on what kind of scene you’re going to be running at what point in the evening. If the game ends at midnight, and the villain gets unmasked at 11:30, it’s time to enter the push toward the final showdown – take whatever decisions get made at that point, and raise the consequences appropriately. Haven’t unmasked the villain at 11:45? Do so in the next scene. Make him a little careless. Bring in the final showdown, lights and guns blazing. It’s 10:30? That last decision point might be a great springboard for you to introduce your Big Plot Twist. Keying into these kinds of things can lend a little structure to your sessions and cast the whole thing into a sense of the familiar, despite the fact that you don’t know what the scenes are going to be.</p>

<p>All this advice can be applied in a larger scale also, if you’re looking to run a whole series of adventures. With ten aspects per character and an average of three to four players in a group, you have plenty of material to thread a long-running series together that makes those characters matter. If you want to spread the love further, you can deliberately center individual adventures on the aspects of a couple of PC’s who become your “stars” for that storyline. Players usually won’t mind this kind of focusing if they’re confident that they’ll also get their time in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The Dynamic game is a little looser than the Structured game from above, but it has a tighter framework and more narrative thrust (i.e., deliberate plot structure) than the Aspected game. Designing it is still pretty procedural, but it depends a lot on the GM being able to set the balls in motion, and keep track of where they go.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id865" id="set-up-the-board" name="set-up-the-board">Set Up the Board</a></h4>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Step One: What is the Hook?</dt>
<dd>A dynamic game begins with a central hook. It might be a thing, like a valuable treasure or a trade secret. It could be a person, like a traveling billionaire, a famous diva or a brilliant scientist. It might even be a place, like an opera house on opening night, or a just-disturbed gravesite. What it is doesn’t matter, what does matter is what people want with it.  &lt;Example&gt;</dd>
<dt>Step Two: Who Wants It?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The next thing you need is an NPC. The best choice for the first NPC is the character you expect to be the villain of the piece. That character has an interest in the hook. Maybe they want to steal it, maybe they want to destroy it. The why, will be answered in the next question.</p>
<p class="last">“Who” does not always need to be one person. It may be a group, such as an organization, or perhaps an interested individual and his lieutenant.  These secondary characters usually are just extensions of the motives of the main character.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Step Three: What is He Going to Do With It?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Ask yourself, if no-one got in the way, and nothing went wrong, what is the NPC going to do with the hook? What’s their plan?</p>
<p>Bear in mind, when you answer this question, you’re really looking in the medium term. In the short term, they’ll be doing whatever they can to get (or protect or destroy or eat or whatever) the hook, and in the long term, they’ll have applied whatever it is they did with the thing and started using it towards their ultimate goal. The medium term plan is what they’re going to have to do to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>Note, sometimes what the character plans and what the actual consequences are not the same thing in all cases. Thieves stealing something dangerous to sell, but instead being inflicted with a terrible curse, is a great example of how this can go wrong.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p class="last">Notice that because plans are medium term, the result is very rarely something so extreme as “and then I rule the world”. Instead, it focuses on a step in the process towards ruling the world.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Step Four: Is That Enough?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If you think you’ve got enough to start things going, then rock on. If not, go back to step two and come up with a new NPC, and answer questions two and three. Keep doing this until you feel you have a sufficiently dynamic situation and a clear picture of what’s going on.</p>
<p class="last">In these subsequent steps, take a moment to consider the characters’ aspects.  If they have any aspects for appropriate NPCs, this is a great time to bring them in. Barring that, take a look over the aspects and see if you can bring in NPCs whose plans or motives are going to resonate with those aspects.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<p>Once you’ve complicated the mix enough, you should have several potentially competing threads. Each participant has their own goal, and it’s very unlikely that they can all get what they want. At the same time, the competing goals should suggest a matrix for how the story would work itself out if no one else got involved. Stop and take a moment to think about how you would see this playing out if the players never got involved.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<p>Once you’ve looked at the big picture, it should suggest the direction the narrative is going at the point when the players get involved. Figure out where the players enter into the situation, and then simply start having events play out. When players do take action, consider the consequences of their actions, and whether or not it increases the likelihood of one or another of the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Players may end up supporting one of the NPC’s goals, but the GM needs to be prepared for them bringing the situation to an entirely different conclusion.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id868" id="plan-it-out" name="plan-it-out">Plan It Out</a></h4>
<p>Give a little bit of thought to the likeliest outcomes. You’re not obliged to make any of these happen, but these are the things the NPCs will be actively working to make happen, so there should at least be a decent chance of it occurring.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<p>If it makes it easier, imagine the hook as a small sphere. Each interested NPC has an arrow running through the sphere from their name to their goal. With multiple hooks in play, each character may have multiple arrows. Use this map to keep you aware of what’s going on with the characters you bring into a scene at any point.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<p>Ok, so, the pacing didn’t go quite right, and you finished the first chain of events too quickly. You need to do more and you need to do it quickly. No problem at all! Start with the goal that was successfully achieved, whatever it was – that is the new hook. Some of the same characters are probably still interested, but some will probably have dropped off the map. Replace them with new interested parties until you’ve rebuilt the model. With a few minutes’ break, you should be ready to go all over again.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt to think about these potential outcomes, but don’t get too attached. The one thing they don’t account for is the goal achieved by the characters if they do something entirely unexpected. Thankfully, the same model can be used: look at what the characters accomplished, and use it as the hook for the next setup.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
</div>

<p>It’s worth noting that this tends to assume complex, multi-motivational situations. That’s great for establishing things, but as you move out to secondary hooks, feel free to loosen up a bit, and make the sole obstacle to the goal something simple, like a temple full of death traps.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can complicate the path to the hook. If the hook is not immediately accessible, interested parties may need to go through one or more intervening steps before they can interact with the hook. For example, there may be a temple deep in the jungle as the hook for multiple groups, but there are still the dangers of the jungle to get through before that is ever an issue. This allows you to combine the dynamic factors coming from active, agenda driven NPCs with more traditional problems.</p>

<p>Each of these approaches to running a pickup game have been presented to
you in a pure form – and you could certainly pick any one choice and run
a great, solid pickup game using it. But your real ninja power as a GM is
going to come from putting all of them in a big blender and turning it on
to puree.</p>
<p>The structured pickup game provides a good, default set of bones for any adventure. This makes it the ideal fall-back position if the other two strategies are running dry on you. And any dynamic pickup game is going to be stronger if you take the aspected perspective on it, and work your aspectbased decision points into it.</p>
<p>Think of this as a hammer, screwdriver, and wrench. Each tool has a particular function that it’s especially good at, but without all three, your toolbox just isn’t complete.</p>

<p>Pulp is exactly the right kind of genre for a pickup game because it’s so damn simple. Pulp isn’t complicated. Good is generally good, bad is generally bad, science and good intentions fix the world’s ills, and evil can be defeated with determination and two swinging fists.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say your pulp scenarios can’t have some complexity here and there – everyone loves a good mystery now and again – but pulp really starts to sing when it builds a kind of crazy, tumbling-ever-forward momentum.  A good pulp game session should leave the players feeling like they were desperately scrambling all over the surface of some monolithic vehicle hurtling with great determination at a very tall, very unsympathetic wall – and managed, somehow, to pull it all together at the last minute.</p>
<p>To say it another way, great pulp games are nearly always some kind of a race – against a clock, against distance, against an opponent. Everything is in motion, and conclusions – coming right at you – are inevitable. When your players cross the finish line, it should be with the same panting elation of a runner who came in first by the skin of his teeth thanks to a desperate last-minute sprint.</p>
<p>Some GMs can manage this just by exercising the techniques they’ve already honed, but many of us are not so blessed. This chapter’s already given a number of ideas for how to run your game such that you’ll have room to create the kind of experience we’re talking about. Here we’ll focus on techniques that directly address the idea of the “race”.</p>

<p>Action is the proud beating heart of adventure fiction. It’s the GM’s job to see that that heart never skips a beat. Read on, fair GM, and learn the true tempos of your pulp game’s heart.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id876" id="put-them-on-the-clock" name="put-them-on-the-clock">Put Them on the Clock</a></h4>
<p>There’s nothing like a clock for keeping your game’s metronome regular.  Whether you’re running a pickup game or a longer series, you’ve already got one clock going – the length of real time for the session. You should already have a concern for making sure that you pack in enough events and interest in the bounds of that clock’s timeframe, but here, we’re talking about something else.</p>
<p>We’re talking, instead, about the in-game clock – something which the characters should always hear ticking away over their shoulder, hounding them. In-game time pressure is vital to encouraging an ongoing action atmosphere. No situation that needs the players to act should come up without having some sort of time limit on it before dire consequences shall befall the dawdler.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>As a GM, you should tune your ear to the sound of this clock, and move quickly to renew it whenever the sound falls silent. The tension in a dramatic scene should never fall slack; if it does – put them on the clock! Your players could use the occasional nudge to get going; they may be inclined to sit around and talk rather than take action – put them on the clock!</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id877" id="provide-plenty-of-cues-and-clues" name="provide-plenty-of-cues-and-clues">Provide Plenty of Cues and Clues</a></h4>
<p>You may think you’ve given the players all the clever hints and subtle cues necessary to solve the riddle and get to the heart of the matter … but they’re sitting there looking unsure of what to do, or asking all the questions that <em>aren’t</em> on target. The game is, in essence, paralyzed. Why did it happen?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s likely you only have yourself to blame. If all those questions the players are asking are off-target, it’s very likely because you didn’t make the target big enough. If they’re sitting around and unsure of what actions they can or should take, you probably didn’t give them enough cues as to what their options are.</p>
<p>We’re not saying that you shouldn’t leave the field open for players to pursue whatever agendas they want to – because after all the characters are the big focus of the game. But when players stop having somewhere to go (and whether or not that’s true from <em>your</em> perspective is irrelevant if it’s effectively true from <em>theirs</em>), it’s because you didn’t show them what the destinations were.  <em>Show them</em>.</p>
<p>Pulp plots have a certain <em>inevitability</em> baked right in. This is <em>not</em> the same as saying they’re built to “railroad” the players. Rather, each step that is taken should naturally reveal the shape of the next ones available. In a vacuum, players will follow that shape, so long as it’s clear enough to be recognizable.  &lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>If you’re putting together a mystery in a pulp game, for example, then you <em>must</em> make sure that there’s more than one way to solve it. You should also exercise a broad tolerance for wacky solutions that the players come up with (but we’ll get more into that below), or letting them pursue some side-threads before getting back to the main one (if it seems to be dragging the game off course, however, make sure you’ve put the main thread <em>on the clock</em>, as above).</p>
<p>This goes back to what we said just a little bit earlier. The targets you put into the story need to be big enough – big enough to be noticed and to suggest a course of action, and big enough to be hit if someone’s trying to come at it from any number of directions. Paralysis arises from a simple lack of the obvious. Don’t be <em>afraid</em> of the obvious – it’s part of pulp. <em>Provide plenty of cues and clues</em>, and your players will move ever forward.</p>

<blockquote>
“A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.”

<p>The General may as well have been talking about pulp when he said that.  Players are going to be more likely to take an action-oriented approach if they feel like they aren’t going to be penalized for less-than-perfect plans.  Be understanding of flaws and be willing to gloss over them in the interests of fun and entertainment.</p>
<p>Even if you can see several holes in a plan, don’t go taking advantage of those holes right off. Villains can have blind spots; they’re not perfect either. Jeopardize the holes, certainly, to increase the drama, but don’t go after them to the point of unraveling the plan. If it’s even halfway decent (and especially if it’s violent or involves characters taking some kind of crazy risk), then it’s going to make for a solid, entertaining element of the story. Support their plan – like it – and be glad to be a part of it!</p>

<p>Sitting around and thinking about things can be the death of pulp. The characters are men and women of action.</p>
<p>When given the choice among “thinky/ talky”, and “smashy”, smashy wins!</p>
<p>This is not to say that the <em>thinky/talky</em> side of things shouldn’t get its screen time. The world of pulp is also the land of strange technologies that need examining, ancient inscriptions that need deciphering, and powerful delegates that need schmoozing. But each of those is only half of a pulp situation, never its whole. Strange technologies that need examining <em>can come to life, attacking all in the lab!</em> Indecipherable inscriptions that need deciphering <em>unlock tombs chock full of death traps!</em> And powerful delegates that need schmoozing are <em>the targets of sinister assassins!</em></p>
<p>Dropping action into the middle of an otherwise contemplative scene can liven up the game, keeping things jumpy and in motion. Don’t be shy about doing it. But <em>do</em> be shy about doing it when characters are interacting with each other excitedly. The idea here is to <em>encourage</em> action over contemplation – not to mandate it. A good social scene where everyone’s chewing the scenery is fantastic – you don’t want to nip that in the bud by any means. What you <em>do</em> want to prevent is the spiral from that point towards things which are less interesting. Stay sensitive to the nature and pace of the conversation, and when it starts slowing down, make sure that action awaits.</p>
<p>When the thinky or talky side of things comes up, you should still make sure it’s <em>valuable</em>. If the players have created characters who are eminent scholars and scientists, or people well-connected in the halls of power, they should get every chance to make use of those skills. But these sorts of examinations, discoveries, and conversations should be abbreviated where possible, and should <em>always</em> give quick rise to potentials for action. They can be the glue that holds together two pieces of action, but without those two pieces, they are glue best kept in the bottle.</p>
<p>It boils down to this: when in doubt, fill out the second half of something thinky or talky with something dynamic, exciting, and pregnant with the potential for violence – something smashy! <em>Encourage action over contemplation.</em> &lt;Example&gt;</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id880" id="allow-two-fists-to-solve-what-ails-us" name="allow-two-fists-to-solve-what-ails-us">Allow Two Fists to Solve What Ails Us</a></h4>
<p>Part and parcel of accepting the action principle of pulp is embracing the idea that two swinging fists (and a mug full of raw determination and good intent) are enough to get through just about any situation. In pulp, violence <em>works</em> as a solution.</p>
<p>Some of this idea overlaps with the <em>action over contemplation</em> principle. If someone is struggling with something thinky or talky, it’s appropriate to give them something they can smash to get their answers (provided that the group is otherwise stymied with the less violent approaches).  This also means that the characters shouldn’t face problems that are impossible to fight. Pulp is simple, and occasionally players will want to dive into the simplest solutions, and hitting something until it stops doing the bad thing is really, elementally simple.</p>
<p>There are, of course, complications to this. Should you allow swinging fists to solve the problem of the snooty bureaucrat? Well, no (even if it does make the character feel better). What we’re talking about here is the use of fists (and guns, and weapons) against the <em>big</em> problems of the adventure.  If a giant monster is trying to eat your apartment, you <em>can</em> fight it to solve the problem. If a vastly powerful mathemagician has run off with your girlfriend and plans to incant dark equations that will siphon off her life force – your guns <em>will</em> be proof against his evil.</p>
<p>In pulp, when the cards are down, and the big doom is upon us, violence doesn’t beget violence – violence begets victory. <em>Allow two fists to solve what ails!</em></p>

<p>Games will inevitably stagnate at some point or another, no matter how much effort is put into heading off that undesirable eventuality. Leads will get exhausted, players will get frustrated with puzzles, and nobody will come up with a good, crazy plan to save the day. There’s only one thing you could possibly do in such a situation.</p>
<p>Send in the ninjas.</p>
<p>Seriously. Send in the ninjas.</p>
<p>For one, a good sudden explosion of violence gives you time, as a GM, to think, and gives everyone else something to do too, what with all the pointed sticks and knives and poison darts and kung-fu fists and feet flying at their heads.</p>
<p>For two, the ninjas will inevitably fall before the derring-do of the heroes, and then they’ll have someone to interrogate. By this time you’ll have used the combat time to figure out where to send folks next.</p>
<p>Naturally, the captured ninja in question will only offer enough information after a good Intimidate roll (okay, if you’re at this point, really, any Intimidate roll) to point the characters as to where and what to do next, before the cyanide capsule he has under his tongue dissolves and kills him, or a more talented villain nearby puts an arrow through his heart, but by that time, he’s said enough, and the game is back on a roll.</p>
<p>Naturally you don’t always have to dress the ninjas up like ninjas. Sometimes they’ll be the shambling undead. Sometimes they’ll dress up in pin-stripe suits and carry tommy guns and say things like “youse guys” and “fuggedaboudit” instead of “kii-yah!” and “you want to fight – fight me!” But make no mistake, though their costumes and customs may be different, you are dropping ninjas onto the party, and it’s time to go to town.</p>
<p>But beware! Use the power of the ninjas carefully. There <em>is</em> such a thing – though we know you may doubt it! – as <em>too many ninjas</em>. Overuse of this technique leads to players getting wise to it real fast, and one too many fights of this nature can start to feel like hollow or meaningless victories.  Try the other things we’ve talked about first, but when all else fails… send in the ninjas.</p>

<p>There’s one trick to remember with the ninjas, or whatever else you send in. Players can get pretty accustomed to threats to themselves. Nothing is more frustrating than having some gun toting mooks come in through the door, get creamed, and have the players go back to studying their navels.</p>
<p>When this is a concern, the trick is to have the ninjas bust in <em>on someone else</em>! The players may be blasé about attacks on themselves, but if the ninjas attack the shoeshine guy at the corner that’s suddenly a challenge and a mystery! Can they save the guy in time? And even if they can, why are ninjas after him?</p>

<p>There’s a hearty embrace of cliché which, while not necessary, can go a long way to making an adventure feel like it’s a “pulp” adventure. One thing you can do to help this out is to add a twist.</p>
<p>Once you’ve thought up a reasonable explanation for events, add one more layer. Don’t make things more complicated. Instead, make them more colorful. If your story involves gangsters, consider making them zombie gangsters, kung fu gangsters, gangsters with freeze rays, gangsters led by a talking gorilla, or anything else that comes to mind. In most games, you would not want to overuse this sort of thing, but for pulp, it’s encouraged.</p>
</div>

<p>When you need to introduce a new character, simply start with a blank character sheet and fill in a few critical pieces of data – their best skill, a stunt or two, the aspects that jump out at you as most important – and leave the rest blank. When a situation arises where the NPC needs to roll a skill or use an aspect you haven’t written down, go ahead and write it down in one of the blank slots, then roll appropriately. This results in NPCs getting fleshed out over time without needing to invest a lot of time or effort up front.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id885" id="r-e-s-p-e-c-t" name="r-e-s-p-e-c-t">9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R-E-S-P-E-C-T</a></h3>
<p>A lot of games center on a ragtag band who exist in the grey area outside of society where they live a life of danger and adventure. This is only half true for characters. They get the danger and adventure, certainly, but they are also firmly within the bounds of society. They are storied individuals, and the people they meet are going to develop opinions of them over time, both good and bad.</p>
<p>Two things are true of the player’s characters – they are heroes (we hope) and they are very good at what they do. That should merit a certain amount of respect from the NPCs they deal with.</p>
<p>Now, a certain amount of fawning and sycophancy is to be expected. The characters get invited to all the best parties and will always have people wanting to bend their ear because they’re presumed to be well connected, but that’s admiration, not respect. Some players really enjoy that, so feel free to heap it on, but respect is a rarer, more valuable gift for characters.  Respect only really matters when it’s coming from people who understand what you do. The world may recognize that Maggie Honor is a brilliant engineer, but that doesn’t mean as much as when Dr. Avenarius Herborn pauses for just a moment, impressed by her latest creation. When Diego McKinnon cows a group of thugs, that’s no great thing, and it’s nothing compared to when a hot up and coming gunslinger shows a tiny bit of quiver of fear in his voice when he speaks because this is Sky Freakin’ Hobo!</p>
<p>Opponents, rivals and peers should be aware of what players do, and should be respectful of it. One way this manifests is that opponents will plan based on you being awesome, and try to take it into account. Traditionally, this is done by the villain doing something cheesy that completely devalues the characters’ strengths. This is lame and almost insulting. The villain should provide a check against the character, not simply overwhelm him.</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;Example&gt;</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note: all of the cheesy options are valid adventure hooks if, and only if, they are the central hook of the adventure. Depriving Diego of his Hobo Harpoon is fine for the adventure about Diego needing to cross a war zone on foot to get back to his jet pack, but depriving it for the adventure about Dr. Avenarius Herborn’s attempt to split pi is just lame.</p>
<p>This may seem like a lot of space for a very small thing, but please remember it. When characters get a little bit of the respect that they feel their characters deserve, it’s a big payout for the players.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id886" id="deathtraps-and-other-dooms" name="deathtraps-and-other-dooms">9.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deathtraps and Other Dooms</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the characters will be faced with situations where the potential for a lethal outcome is clear - fights on the edge of a bottomless chasm, crossing a field full of artillery fire, trapped in a building with a big bomb – that sort of thing. Certainly, if the character were to fall into the chasm, get hit by an artillery shell, or be caught in the explosion, it would be the end for them.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, try to never put a character in a situation where it is “make this roll or die”. Instead, have the threat affect the contest in other ways – an artillery shell landing nearby should scatter the combatants, not decimate them. A nearby hazard like a bottomless crevasse provides color to descriptions, and is best used as an aspect for the scene.</p>
<p>All that said, while you should go out of your way to try to keep these things from bringing about an arbitrary death, sometimes characters do die, and when that time comes, let it happen with dignity, and help the player get his next character started as quickly as possible.  A little heartless? Yes, but it’s necessary – if death is entirely impossible, the game shifts from pulp to being a full on cartoon.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id887" id="information-management" name="information-management">9.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Management</a></h3>
<p>Information management: what does that mean? Consider for a second that as a GM, you know a <em>lot</em>. You’ve read the whole book, you’ve got some notes, you have solid ideas of what makes the various NPCs tick. You’ve got information that you probably haven’t even thought about yet, that you just think of as logical extensions of what you know. As a GM, one of your most important jobs is making sure that that information flows steadily towards the players – too little and they may grow frustrated, too much and they’ll get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The trick of this is that you need to control the quality of the information the players receive. This is partly about interest level – if you read a passage straight from a textbook, don’t expect a lot of interest – but it is more about how you expect the information to be used.  Practically speaking, there are two types of information, color and drama.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id888" id="color" name="color">Color</a></h4>
<p>A lot of information is going to provide color. Most descriptions and explanations are color. Color is most important to maintaining the feel of the world – if you don’t provide things like descriptions, play begins to resemble little more than a board game. On the other hand, if there’s any kind of information you’re liable to provide too much of, it’s probably going to be color.  There’s no one way to do color right, but there are a few guidelines.</p>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id889" id="scenes" name="scenes">Scenes</a></h5>
<p>The first is to realize that people don’t need all the details to fill in the appropriate ones. If you describe a narrow alley between two brownstones, a lot of players will fill in things like windows and fire escapes, maybe even trash cans and litter without you needing to describe “four by three windows every twelve feet or so, and a rusty fire escape going up to the next floor”.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id890" id="improvising-detail" name="improvising-detail">Improvising Detail</a></h6>
<p>Sometimes players will have a slightly different view of things than you. If this difference is drastic, it may result in them taking an action that doesn’t entirely make sense. When this happens, just ask the player what they expect. If they’re making an assumption that seems entirely unreasonable, you may need to discuss that with them, but if it’s not unreasonable, then it’s an excellent opportunity to suggest to the player that this would be a good use of the editing power of a fate point (page XX).  Usually, the player’s expectations are more minor, and usually come in the form of “Is there a ladder here?” The answer to a question like that depends on your response. If you feel the answer is “yes”, or even “no, but there should have been, why didn’t I think of that?” then say yes. If you feel the answer is “no, but while that’s not very likely, it’s not unreasonable” then the answer to give is “I don’t know, is there?” while looking meaningfully at the player’s fate points. It is only if you feel that the request is entirely out of line that your answer should be “No .”</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id891" id="people" name="people">People</a></h5>
<p>As with scenes, don’t try to provide too much detail. Players usually pick one or two things to remember a character by, so try to pick perhaps three elements and describe those. If there’s some other element you need to reveal, work it into the scene, describing it as part of an action the character takes.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id892" id="a-trick" name="a-trick">A Trick</a></h6>
<p>Find an author whose work you enjoy, and take a moment to look at how they describe things and people. When a new character shows up, how much time does the author spend on the description? How many elements does the author reveal? Every author has a slightly different cadence, but if you can isolate one that you enjoy, you may find that using it to provide your own color makes your life much easier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id893" id="drama" name="drama">Drama</a></h5>
<p>Drama is that information which leads directly to action. The clearest form of drama is the immediate threat – “there’s an axe swinging towards your head, what do you do?” – but there are also discoveries like “This clearly proves the Colonel is the killer. What do you do?” Implicit in any dramatic information is that question: What do you do?</p>
<p>The hardest part about providing such information is remembering that the more immediate the requirement for action is, the better. Consider the second example above – you have proof that the Colonel is the killer. If all the suspects are just milling about waiting for the detectives to come along, then there is no immediacy. The players could sit on the information as long as they like, pursue secondary goals and otherwise generally twiddle their thumbs until they feel like it.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the Colonel is already across town, and he’s about to have a private audience with the likely next victim, then the characters must act! Naturally, the Colonel has cut the phone lines, so the players are going to have to race across town to try to catch him at the last moment!</p>
<p>Assuming that the second description is closer to the kind of game you want to run, there are three necessary elements to any dramatic reveal: tension, consequence and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Tension</strong> is required to make sure that a choice must be made now. This usually means that the matter is time sensitive in some way. Tension is also the implicit difficulty of the task at hand. If it can be done casually, there’s no tension to speak of because no choice needs to be made. Tension is what forces the player’s hand, and makes them make a choice.</p>
<p>The most important <strong>consequence</strong> of any piece of dramatic information is what will happen if the players do nothing. Whatever those consequences are, they should be bad – inaction should always be one of the worst choices that the players can make.</p>
<p>Even if you get the other two elements, they’ll be nothing but frustrating
unless you also provide <strong>clarity</strong> – players must have at least one clear course of action available to them. Without that, the players are reduced to being spectators, which is not where they want to be. Don’t be afraid to be obvious. The clearest course of action may be a simple as “Get over there and keep hitting him ‘til candy comes out!” Even if there are multiple potential courses of action, go out of your way to make sure that the players are aware of at least one with a better outcome than the consequence of doing nothing.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id894" id="consequence-consequence-consequence" name="consequence-consequence-consequence">Consequence, Consequence, Consequence</a></h6>
<p>Tension and clarity are usually the easy part of the equation. Tension is usually just an extension of the consequence, and clarity depends mostly on the GM’s ability to communicate. Consequence is really the heart and soul of drama, and as a GM, you are going to need to get a firm grasp on what that means.</p>
<blockquote>
The simple yardstick for consequence is how much the players are invested in it. Sounds easy, sure, but what are your players going to invest in? For some players, it’s going to be the same things that their characters are invested in. For others it’s going to be whatever makes for the most interesting story. For others, it will need to be a threat directly to themselves or their stuff.</blockquote>
<p>No one knows your group better than you do, so there’s a limit to how far our advice can take you. Make the decisions that work best for you. Still, in case it’s useful, here are a few tips.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Consequences that are absolute (death and destruction) are usually less potent than more transitory ones (injury and damage). While may seem counterintuitive, it makes sense if you remember that if an NPC dies, it’s very sad, but it is only if they’re badly injured that they can blame the character for what happened to them.</li>
<li>Especially avoid any consequence that will end the game. When you plan a consequence, you must be sure you have a plan for how things will move forward if it comes to pass.</li>
<li>A consequence that makes characters look foolish is surprisingly motivational, especially if you make sure NPCs have long memories.</li>
<li>Remember, consequences don’t always need to be bad. The only thing that needs to be bad is that inaction is the worst option, but that can be highly relative. If a player discovers that he has a winning lottery ticket, but has only 10 minutes to get to the office to turn it in, then you have all the elements you need: tension (only 10 minutes to get across town), consequence (if no action is taken, the player won’t win, but if he succeeds, he’ll get a prize) and clarity (get to the ticket office, and fast!).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id895" id="clarity-and-choice" name="clarity-and-choice">Clarity and Choice</a></h6>
<blockquote>
Sometimes (almost always, even) a piece of dramatic information will have more than one potential course of action available as a reasonable response.  Sometimes the difference is merely one of tactics or appearance, but sometimes the choice needs to be made between multiple options which each have consequences (albeit consequences which are not as bad as doing nothing).</blockquote>
<p>Now, these choices are good opportunities for play all by themselves, but as a GM, these are the moments you want to look for. These are the times when a character’s aspects are at their most meaningful – if they have two choices, and their aspects would lean them towards one over the other, that’s exactly when you roll out a fate point and brandish it casually. If the choice their aspect leans towards is a little tougher, that’s even better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id896" id="getting-blindsided" name="getting-blindsided">Getting Blindsided</a></h6>
<p>Players will sometimes outsmart you, or just get crazy lucky. Sometimes you will provide a piece of dramatic information and have all the pieces in place and they will respond in a way that comes completely out of left field, and which undercuts your entire expectation for the scene, perhaps even leapfrogging past any amount of preparation you’ve done. This is insanely frustrating, and the instinct is to immediately invent a reason why they can’t do that so as to force them back on track.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>For the love of all that is holy, don’t do it.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you do this, your players will know. They will. Honest. And they’ll think it sucks because it will feel like you’re punishing them for getting into the game. And they’ll be right.</p>
<p>If this happens, roll with it. You should have a strong enough sense of the motives of the various NPCs in play, their plans and consequences that you should be able to adapt to it. And if you can’t? Don’t sweat it. Take a second, look sheepish, then praise your players. Let them know they did something pretty clever, and have them take a few minutes to grab a drink or a smoke or whatever while you rough up some notes to deal with this.  It’ll work out, and by the time they get back, you’ll probably find you’ve been inspired by this turn of events. So there’s your pressure valve: confess to getting caught off guard, step back, look at what’s happened, and you’ll find yourself fueled by this turn of events rather than burned. Your players will get a chance to grin and feel clever out on the back deck while you prepare their next challenge.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id897" id="building-a-mystery" name="building-a-mystery">Building a Mystery</a></h5>
<p>Now that you have a clear idea of the difference between color and drama, you need to keep it in mind as you play. One of the most frustrating things that can happen in play is that the GM muddles the two, and includes some dramatic information in the midst of a barrage of color and expects his players to “catch on”. This is dirty pool, and it leads to nothing but frustration. Don’t mix these things up. There are always cases which seem like they’re a little bit of both, and handling them can be tricky. The cases you most want to look for are <strong>clues</strong> and <strong>tells</strong>.</p>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id898" id="tells" name="tells">Tells</a></h6>
<p>Tells are pieces of color information that may seem like dramatic information, but aren’t. They are pieces of information which wave a flag and say “there’s something to investigate here!” without revealing what that <em>something</em> is. Think of them as a bit like a poker “tell” – something’s showing on that guy’s face, <em>but what does it mean?</em> Tells draw in player curiosity without innately satisfying it – until that player then takes action to dig deeper. Therefore, in practice a tell is usually a piece of information about a person or thing which is not immediately apparent to all observers, but which one character discovers. While this information may provide perspective, or be useful in any number of ways, it <em>suggests no course of action</em> (other than saying “there’s a rock to turn over here!”), which is why it stays firmly in the color camp.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>The line between a tell (color), and drama that the player doesn’t care about, is almost indistinguishable.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Tells should be interesting. As color, interest is their only currency, and they may eventually turn some <em>other</em> piece of information into drama rather than color, or it may influence a choice later on. Tells are also a great way for you, as a GM, to test the waters of player interest. In a given situation, if a player picks up four tells, but only pursues two, the ones he pursues are where you want to situate your plot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id899" id="clues" name="clues">Clues</a></h6>
<p>Clues are pieces of information that are dramatic, but which handle tension and clarity differently than usual. Usually, tension exists for the larger situation, rather than for an individual clue. When a character is faced with a complex piece of drama, it is often broken into smaller sections, represented as clues.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;: What's the next (immediate) action of the characters?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is usually “look for clues”, but that’s a fairly meaningless piece of advice. Clues, as discrete pieces of information, must also suggest action, but that action may simply lead to the next clue. This is a very tricky balancing act, but done right, it means that each clue is its own piece of dramatic information. But to look at these clues another way, they all have the same tension and consequence, and they only vary in terms of clarity. Thus, for a mystery, the mystery itself provides the tension and consequence, but not the clarity, while each clue may provide no new consequences or tension, but does provide clarity. This sequence of clues is the <em>chain of evidence</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;Example&gt;</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id900" id="tells-and-clues" name="tells-and-clues">Tells and Clues</a></h6>
<p>Tells should not be clues in their own right, but they can affect the clarity of a clue, by making it clear that there are more options than the obvious. To the player, this distinction may seem almost unnoticeable, but it’s useful for the GM to keep in mind because it’s critical for keeping mysteries framed in such a way that they are neither to easy not or hard to solve.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Notice that the tell expanded the options for the clue, but it was the clue itself that suggests the course of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h6><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id901" id="secrets-kill" name="secrets-kill">Secrets Kill!</a></h6>
<p>Now, bearing in mind that we’ve been talking about mysteries here, at no point have we talked about how to <em>keep</em> information from players. There’s a simple reason for that – <em>it’s a bad idea</em>.</p>
<p>This returns to that core responsibility of the GM as the provider of information, but here is a basic rule of thumb: <em>if there is a piece of information to be found, a player should find it, the only question is when and how</em>. A piece of information in your notes should be treated like a gun introduced in the first act of a play – it’s going to go off sometime before the end. By the same token, if there’s a secret door in the complex, then it is not the player’s responsibility to find it, it is <em>your</em> responsibility to show it to them.</p>
<p>This may seem overly generous, like you’re giving everything to players on a silver platter, but remember that it is the <em>player’s</em> responsibility to act, and to face the consequences of his actions. Rather than hand the results to the players outright, you are giving the players <em>opportunities</em> to act.</p>
<p>How do you make that happen? <em>Stick to the rules of providing drama</em>. As long as there is tension and consequence to make players act, and clarity to provide them a means to act, then you’re good to go.</p>

<p>When players set out to gather information, be it research, contact or any other means, you need to decide if they’re going to get drama, a clue, or a tell. This is partly influenced by the situation, and partly influenced by your read of player intent.</p>
<p>If the characters already have a dramatic situation, but they’re gathering information because they don’t see the clear path of action, then they should find a tell which helps provide the clarity.</p>
<p>If the characters already have a dramatic situation and they see at least one clear path, but they’re researching to try to find another (or to find another solution entirely) then you make a judgment call. If there is another potential path that you think would be useful for them to see, give them a tell that points to that. If you think the players are grasping at straws, take a moment to assess the situation. It’s possible you’ve been too harsh, and your players are flailing around, looking for an alternative. If you agree, this might be your cue to throw them a rope, and introduce a new option with a tell. Of course, if you think they’re just trying to weasel out of a tough choice, then give them a tell that underlines the forthcoming consequence (your most basic form of clarity is a simple reminder).</p>
<p>The best way to tell which one players are doing is this simple test: Are they trying to simplify a complex situation so that no one has to suffer any consequences ? If so, they’re acting like bureaucrats, not heroes, and you need to emphasize to them that their job is to do the best they can with what they have – not to spin their wheels endlessly worrying about what-ifs.</p>
<p>If the characters are already in a mystery, then they’re probably researching to get more clarity on their clue, so feel free to provide a tell to that end.  If, however, characters are gathering information because the players can’t think of anything else to do, then it’s time to throw some <em>drama</em> at them.  That’s what they’re here for.</p>

<p>When you tell a player to pick up the dice, you’re communicating that something is about to happen. In fact, sometimes, the entire point of the roll is to communicate that something is going on far more than to find out how well the character rolled. These are situations were you could just tell the player that they see something, but by first calling for an Alertness or Drive or other roll, you capture their attention. Generally, you can use their roll to indicate how to twist the description. If they roll badly, perhaps something goes wrong, or you couch the data in very obscure terms.  If they roll very well, you’re welcome to throw in some extra detail, which may be a clue, or may just be a bit of extra flourish.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>One important qualifier on testing the breeze – sometimes players will look at a bad roll and feel they need to use aspects or fate points to bump it up. You can discourage them, a simple “Don’t worry about it, I was just checking something” will often suffice. If you don’t want to discourage them, however, take it as a reminder that you need to create an opportunity for that character to earn that FP back as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Not every GM realizes the importance of controlling the audience’s (i.e., the players’) perspective in a game, but it’s just as important in a roleplaying game as it is in a movie or television show.  What you show the players, how you show it to them, when you show it to them, and what you don’t show are all key components in building excitement and story.</p>
<p>The questions of how to manage perspective are nothing short of vital.  Here, we’ll give you some answers.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id905" id="scene-framing" name="scene-framing">9.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene Framing</a></h3>
<p>If you’ve ever played a roleplaying game before, you’ve framed a scene without thinking about it. Even if you’ve never played a roleplaying game before, you’ll frame a scene without thinking about it. The fact that we give it a formal title may disguise how common it is – <strong>scene framing</strong> is merely what you do when you decide when a scene starts and stops, where it happens, and who’s involved in it. Every time a GM says, “So you’re all sitting in a bar when…” or “So now you get to the villain’s secret hideout…” she’s framing a scene. It’s as simple as establishing the transition for the next piece of game action. The easiest comparison to make is to a film editor, who routinely cuts scenes off and begins others.  That’s scene framing, and everyone does it whether or not they realize it.</p>
<p>So, why point it out? Because <em>mindful</em> scene framing is a GM’s primary tool to establish pace in a session of play, <em>especially</em> in a pickup game. When the pace is flagging, it’s the GM’s responsibility to focus everyone on the game and frame the next scene, to keep things moving along as they should in a pulp game, where the action is fast and the “camera” isn’t willing to focus too long on a particular subject if it no longer serves a purpose in play. This can be a rocky road to walk sometimes – one or all of the players may truly enjoy going through all the minute details of their characters’ shopping trips for better equipment. You’re going to have to cater to those preferences, if the whole group exhibits them. If they don’t, however, you’re going to have to take those rolling eyes as a sign that you need to be proactive about framing scenes. How will you know when to move things?  Look no further than the next few paragraphs.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id906" id="starting-things-off" name="starting-things-off">Starting Things Off</a></h4>
<p>When you frame the beginning of a scene, you’re typically going to want to start it just before an important piece of action (not necessarily violence) is going to take place. If the characters are going to the villain’s hideout, you don’t want to start describing events in the scene from the moment they leave their apartment unless something important is going to occur then.  If Maggie is waiting for a contact to arrive at a rendezvous, you don’t want to start the scene two hours before the contact shows up. This may seem like common sense advice, but it’s something that can trip people up on the fly – it’s easy to fall into a pattern of narrating every block of time the characters spend in play without realizing and chomping up game time with “okay, so you leave the store and start heading back home, and you’re walking down…” kind of material. Keep an eye out for it and cut when necessary to save yourself idle time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id907" id="when-a-scene-is-no-longer-a-scene" name="when-a-scene-is-no-longer-a-scene">When a Scene is No Longer a Scene</a></h4>
<p>How do you know when it’s time to move on? Well, just about every scene you could envision has a purpose, a moment where you can definitively say that the <em>point</em> of the scene has happened. Usually, this happens after the resolution of some kind of conflict, but that isn’t always the case. If the characters are shopping for equipment, the scene’s purpose is for the characters to find out whether or not they can acquire the gear they want. If they can (or can’t), and they know it, the scene is over – whatever bickering Gerald
Carter’s player is doing with the antiques dealer can safely be glossed over. If the characters are trying to figure out the meaning behind an obscure puzzle left at a crime scene, the scene is resolved when they discover (or fail to discover) that clue. If the characters are in a fight, the scene is resolved when that fight’s over and they figure out where to go from there.</p>
<p>Even in purely character-driven scenes, like when Drake’s player wants a scene so he can fail to convince his pursuers how he really converted from being a criminal yet again, that time eventually comes. He’s failed to say what he needs to say, probably milked some fate points out of the GM for good roleplay, shown his true colors, and it’s time to move on. Going into a scene, you have to ask yourself: What’s the point? Why is this scene happening? And when that point occurs, whatever it is, close up loose ends and move on.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id908" id="making-the-transitions" name="making-the-transitions">Making the Transitions</a></h4>
<p>So you’re sitting in play, the time has come to change scenes, and you’re trying not to ruffle feathers when doing it. How do you frame a scene without abusing your power? How do you avoid stealing a player’s thunder if he’s riffing off some good roleplay?</p>
<p>Well, first rule of thumb is that if it looks like your players are getting into the action at hand, let ’em run with it. Unless you’re totally strapped for time, letting the players revel in immersion or in a particular aspect of setting (no pun intended) isn’t going to do your game any harm. Roll with what they give you. You may find your game enhanced by it. It may not be what you planned, but if they enjoy it, your gaming session is a successful one. And if the NPC interactions are interesting enough, you can always take this as a cue to move decision points around to be initiated by different NPCs than you thought. Your plans are the ones that need to be flexible.</p>
<p>The second rule of thumb is that when you’re in doubt, just ask. Your players know you aren’t a mind reader, and no rule in this book can substitute for honest, direct communication with them. You may be in a place where you’re strapped for time and only have the length of one session to run your adventure. If that’s the case, no one’s going to begrudge you asking, “Hey, guys? Gerald’s got the equipment he wanted… can I go ahead and cut to the next scene?” If you have a player who <em>would</em> begrudge you asking that, it might be time to review his inclusion in your game.</p>
<p>The third rule of thumb is that if you feel the purpose of a scene has been fulfilled but you don’t know what to transition to next, then turn to the players and ask them what they want to do. If you’ve set up your decision points right, or some player has a clear goal in mind, they’re more than likely brimming with ideas about what scene they want to run next. All you have to do is solicit ideas, and you have an instant wealth of scenes you can possibly run.</p>
<p>The fourth rule of thumb is that if there’s any dead air, do something. Are the players not talking anymore, looking at you expectantly or at random details of the room? More than likely, a scene’s gone off its course. Do whatever you have to – bring in a new NPC encounter, ask to frame a new scene, narrate two guys bursting in the door with guns – but under any circumstances, do not let dead air dominate your game time. Your time for making stories is valuable; make sure you make it count.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id909" id="camera-work" name="camera-work">9.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera Work</a></h3>
<p>When it comes right down to it, the GM is the director for her game – or at least the <em>cinematographer</em> – and can deliberately control the “camera” through descriptive techniques. When she takes control of the camera, she’s saying to the audience, “Hey – look over here, right now!” This ability of the GM is powerful juju, and if you juggle and tweak it just right, you can really drive up the excitement level of your game.</p>
<p>To pull off solid camera work, you need to picture yourself as the camera crew, a set of ghostly, invisible people placed within the scene. Each interesting thing in the scene should get a camera on it, and any given set of interesting things should contain all of the characters. If a PC is missing from the list, figure out why – it may be a warning sign that you haven’t given them anything interesting to do (and, thus, there’s nothing interesting to point a camera at around them). Come up with something interesting for them, and include them with a camera.</p>
<p>Sometimes even certain NPCs – usually the big villains of the piece – may get a camera as well, but we’ll get into that a bit more in “Cut Scenes”, below.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>In the above example, all of this is one larger scene, yes, but each camera’s point of focus can be looked at as a smaller, contained scene of its own.  The exchanges Drake spends climbing up the temple needn’t be the same exchanges shared by Gerald and the Sky Hobo.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the GM gets to control which camera is turned on, when. When she wants to focus on what Maggie’s doing, she can run a few exchanges’ worth of Maggie struggling to make it up a rusty scaffold; when she wants to watch Drake and the Sky Hobo wallop cultists, she can do much the same.</p>
<p>In situations like these, it’s important to make sure that each camera gets a healthy chunk of screen time. To put it another way, each camera should get roughly the same amount of time and attention. Here, we’re talking more about <em>real time</em> than in-game time – there’s no formula of exchanges-per-camera to be had. Further, with multiple cameras, the length of real time each camera is “on” should be kept short – a few minutes, perhaps, but not much more than five (or <em>maybe</em> eight or ten).</p>
<p>This sort of camera work should be active and deliberate. Think about the angle something would best be filmed at, and describe it from that perspective. Taking the role of the camera man, talk about zooming in on particular details, pulling back to reveal a vaster whole, or panning over to a new, sudden development. You can even use this method to describe transitions from one camera to the next, showing how the smaller scenes are connected inside of the larger whole.</p>
<p>Nearly always, if an exchange has ended on something that would make a good short-term cliffhanger, it’s time to cut over to the next camera.  Other times, it may even be worth it to pause a camera in the <em>middle</em> of an exchange – say, after someone’s made a bad roll – in order to ratchet up the tension.</p>
<p>Bringing this sort of description into full form can give players the immersive sense of starring in a movie, and can go a long way to holding their
attention even when it’s not their camera that’s turned on.</p>
<p>&lt;Example&gt;</p>
<p>Solid camera work achieves two primary goals. First, it makes sure all your players get “spotlight” time.  (This makes players happy, and happy players make a better game .) Second, it drives the pace of your game within the larger scene. In the end, the high action of pulp is only as exciting as how it is filmed. <em>Film it well</em>.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id910" id="cut-scenes" name="cut-scenes">9.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Scenes</a></h3>
<p>If you’re particularly invested in making your game feel like a movie, consider the idea of using a <strong>cut scene</strong>. In this context, a cut scene is a short bit of narration by the GM that follows what’s going on with the NPCs <em>without</em> any of the characters present, while the PCs are off doing whatever it is they’re doing.</p>
<p>Most cut scenes should <em>tease</em> about what the NPCs are doing. For example, you could show two NPCs having a conversation, but don’t let it be too clear what the specific topic is. Other times, you may want to keep one of the NPCs in the scene “off camera”, but heard – and save the revelation of his identity for when the characters actually encounter him.</p>
<p>Cut scenes also work well as an anticipation-building commentary on what the characters are doing. For example, when the PCs have just walked into a trap, consider doing a cut scene to the bad guy (ensconced elsewhere in his lair) saying something sinister and pulling the lever that unleashes the killer robots. “He pulls the lever, cackling. Everyone roll Alertness!” They also work well as transitions from one player scene to the next, particularly if the characters are doing some lengthy travel in between actual on-screen scenes.</p>
<p>Finally, cut scenes can give the audience (your players) a nice view of a hated villain’s demise when their characters aren’t able to stay around to see it themselves (what with them not wanting a more personal demise experience). The sight of the master villain shouting “nooooooo!” as his creations rise up and destroy him, his lab exploding all around, is the stuff of <em>satisfaction</em>. Provide it!</p>
<p>The main wrinkle with cut scenes is all about your comfort level, as a GM, and your players’ comfort level, with the ability to separate the “in character” stuff from the “out of character” stuff.</p>
<p>Cut scenes are there solely for the players’ enjoyment – they provide no information to the characters, and the players shouldn’t act on the information that <em>is</em> supplied. If you stick tightly to the recommendations above – in particular going for the tease and saving the revelation – you shouldn’t run afoul of these issues that much (unless your players just plum don’t like such scenes). But if you do have the kind of trust and comfort levels that let you reveal more, by all means, do so – provided you’re sure you’re keeping your players entertained. Avoid the temptation to hog the spotlight. Cut scenes are spice; they’re not the main dish.</p>

<p>Some skills take a lot of time and their use is best described as a montage. A <em>montage</em> is a term from film that describes a series of short shots that collectively indicate time passing and a character or characters doing something. If you’ve ever seen a training montage in a film where the hero spends several quick scenes lifting weights, running up stairs, practicing under the sharp eye of his mentor, and at the end, he’s mastered whatever he started working on, then you should have a good idea of how a montage should play out.</p>
<p>When you describe a character performing such a task, take a moment to describe a few key scenes, trying to visualize how this might be presented if the story were a movie. This gives an opportunity to give a little more color to long efforts, like researching and contacting.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id912" id="the-long-game-advancement" name="the-long-game-advancement">9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Game: Advancement</a></h2>
<p>SotC is intended to be a pickup game with a revolving cast of players and characters. As such, it’s not truly intended that characters receive individual advancement (character improvement) based on, say, how many adventures they’ve gone on. Instead, the intention is entirely that the characters advance <em>en masse</em> if they do advance at all, with the entire group receiving credit for being a part of the game.</p>
<p>Player characters should always receive the same amount of on-sheet rewards, in order to make sure that everyone remains a peer of one another.  Giving out advancement only to those who manage to attend one or more sessions means you’re penalizing those players who may have busier schedules. It’s impolite; don’t do it. The game will benefit when the characters are mutual peers. No one should come back from a playing hiatus to discover he’s become the sidekick.</p>
<p>The easiest form of reward, and the only one allowed to be a little “uneven” from character to character, is in terms of fate points. If your game allows someone to carry his fate points forward from the last session he was in (if the total’s higher than his refresh rate), then it’s entirely appropriate to give out fate points as rewards for clever, entertaining, or well-crafted play.  Characters with a pile of fate points at the end of a session may also have had less to do, or were particularly “goosed” by compels on their aspects, so letting the karma wagon roll on into their next session is a good way to compensate for whatever the situation was.</p>
<p>In terms of even-handed advancement given to all characters, there are three
ways characters can improve: their skills, their aspects, and their stunts.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id913" id="skills-raising-the-roof" name="skills-raising-the-roof">9.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills: Raising the Roof</a></h3>
<p>It should be rare, if ever, that a GM lets characters raise the peak level (top adjective) of their skill pyramids. The characters that the players embody are Superb-level characters, quite capable in a wide array of activities as it is. Increasing the peak of a skill pyramid increases all the skills underneath as well, and raises the default level for skills not shown. It should only be done to represent a fundamental shift from what the game was about before, and what it has now become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such a change in character power level will only have meaning if the rest of the world does not come along for the ride. Old enemies who might have been supremely potent by comparison will now be more within reach. Normal people, who still cluster around the Mediocre and Average skill levels, get left just a little further behind. If you instead take all, or even more than a few, of the old things and give them the same boost, then everyone is still in the same relative position to one another, and you’ve changed very little about the game.</p>
<p>For this reason and more, we recommend you leave the skill peak where it
is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id914" id="aspects-deepening-the-story" name="aspects-deepening-the-story">9.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspects: Deepening the Story</a></h3>
<p>Any major advancement effort – and in SotC, any amount of advancement should be considered major – should first look to adding aspects to characters.</p>
<p>From the perspective of game rules, adding an aspect has two effects. First, the characters get more opportunities to improve their performance and gain fate points. Second, the refresh rate goes up by one – everyone starts each session with one more fate point.</p>
<p>Looking past the rules, adding an aspect allows a character to open up a new part of his story. The best aspects picked up from advancement are those which are a sort of commentary on in-game experience. These aspects tie characters into the ongoing storyline of the entire series, and as such should be encouraged at every turn.</p>
<p>Maybe a new catch-phrase has shown up for the character (“I Hate It When I’m Right”); maybe he’s made a new enemy or friend who deserves a nod (“Dr. Herborn Must Be Stopped”). If a consequence aspect turned out to make play more entertaining, the character could “promote” it to full permanence – maybe changing it a little, turning a “Lost Eye” into a “Fashionable Eye Patch”.</p>
<p>It’s the player’s choice, in the end – if he wants to go to a place that doesn’t tie back to prior events, that’s fine too. Characters in television and other media reveal new secrets about themselves all the time. Only one aspect should be added in any given “advancement period” and your game should cover a healthy number of sessions in between any increase in the number of aspects the characters get.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id915" id="stunts-new-tricks-for-old-dogs" name="stunts-new-tricks-for-old-dogs">9.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunts: New Tricks for Old Dogs</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the numbers, new characters get half as many stunts as they have aspects. Stunts are potent and game-changing, so this ratio should be maintained when possible.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that characters should get a new stunt on the third “round” of any advancement cycle – the first two would be a new aspect each, and the third would be a stunt. This pattern can “lather, rinse, repeat” from there.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to be stingy about stunts. Stunts are a potent path to carving out individuality and shtick, and if your larger play-group taking part in the pick-up game is big enough, you’ll want to make sure everyone’s niche doesn’t get too threatened. As always, any stunt pick a player makes should be reviewed and approved by the GM.</p>
<p>The first stunt after the starting five is a crucial one. Roughly speaking, every three or so stunts gives a character a potent, easily identified <em>shtick</em>, carving out a niche for them in the story. This means that a sixth stunt potentially increases the number of niches to <em>two</em>. And in some of the more potent stunt combinations, some stunts aren’t even available until someone can take a sixth stunt.</p>
<p>A GM should also be ready for her players to start pushing the boundaries at this point. If a character has maxed out the stunts under a particular skill, but wants to go further, she’ll need to be ready to work with them to create new stunts.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid of the idea of creating new stunts. New stunts are a natural process for the game, and there are plenty of examples in the stunts chapter to draw on as ideas for what does and doesn’t work.</p>
<p>If a player wants a stunt that’s too powerful at this point, come up with a few intermediate steps (stunts) that he’ll have to complete first in order to get it. Stunts with prerequisites are meant to do more than the usual – embrace this principle, and make use of it.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s a final kind of advancement that a GM can make use of in her game, with one catch: it’s not really advancement, per se, even though it can and does represent a kind of character development and growth. In fact, this is the safest option for a GM to offer her players, and even if the GM is running a “growthless” campaign, this approach should be strongly considered for use.</p>
<p>At the end of every session, the GM may offer her players the option to shuffle their sheets around a little. This means the players may do one or more of the following (but not one of the things listed twice or more), all subject to approval:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Swap out one aspect for another</li>
<li>Swap out an Average (lowest rung) skill for another not currently in the pyramid, <em>or</em>, change the places of two skills in the pyramid that are not more than one rung apart from each other.</li>
<li>Drop a stunt <em>that hasn’t seen much use</em>, and pick up a new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind this is that characters, even if they don’t grow in power or necessarily deepen in story, still change over time.  Lessons are learned.  Some abilities fall out of practice, while others come to the fore. This technique helps cover that, and can give players a real feeling of their characters not being the same-old-same-old they started out with on day one.</p>

<p>Every game is a little bit different, but there are a few questions that every GM is going to want to answer for themselves.</p>

<p>The rules, you’ll notice, include space for impossible science and even more impossible magic. These things go hand in hand, and you’re going to have to decide how you want to handle them. There are a few possibilities to choose
from.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id919" id="the-world-outside-your-window" name="the-world-outside-your-window">The World Outside Your Window</a></h4>
<p>In a fairly realistic campaign, the weirdness is almost entirely removed.  Weird Science, Mad Science and the gadgets which require them are no longer allowed, and Mysteries can no longer provide artifacts. Under this setting, the characters are exceptional only due to their training and natural talent, and a number of the setting’s NPCs are no longer valid. You may even want to consider removing Mysteries from your skill list.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id920" id="world-of-mystery" name="world-of-mystery">World of Mystery</a></h4>
<p>This slightly more cinematic campaign presumes that there are oddities, but they are few and far between. Weird Science and Artifacts are available, but are in the hands of very few individuals. There may be one or two incidences of Mad Science in the world, but no more than that, and certainly not for the characters.</p>
</div>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id921" id="world-of-adventure" name="world-of-adventure">World of Adventure</a></h4>
<p>Weird Science is hardly common, but there are easily hundreds of people across the globe practicing some version of it, and a handful push the limits all the further into the realms of Mad Science. Long lost mysteries are still to be found in ancient ruins, and mysterious cults work in the shadows to gather and recover this lost lore. All options are available; and this is the default setting for SotC.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id922" id="world-of-magic" name="world-of-magic">World of Magic</a></h4>
<p>Much like the World of Mystery, there is some Weird Science, and perhaps a tiny bit of Mad Science, but much of that is magic that the scientists have merely not recognized yet. The true power is held by a select few, hidden in the shadows, fiercely guarding the secrets of magic from the crass masses. In this more magical world, the characters may find their roles carry potent symbolism, and Artifacts may access Mad Science improvements.</p>

<p>Science will free us all! As in the World of Adventure, arcane mysteries have a small following, but Weird and even Mad Science run amok! Most every scientist of any stripe in the world has some grasp of Weird Science (change the stunt so that it includes the Scientific Invention stunt’s functions, reducing the number of stunts it takes to get there), and the Mad Scientists number in the hundreds, their rivalries threatening to reshape the world. This option more or less demands an ahistorical game (see below), and is well suited to “retro” science fiction.</p>

<p>As a historical game, there is always the danger that player may do something to change history in small or large ways. You should decide in advance how you intend to address that possibility. There are a couple potential models, which we detail in brief, here; make sure you determine it – and agree upon it with your players – in advance.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id925" id="rigidly-historical" name="rigidly-historical">Rigidly Historical</a></h4>
<p>History will occur as written, no more, no less. The characters’ adventures take place in the margins around real events, but any attempt to alter those events will meet with aggressive failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id926" id="fluid-history" name="fluid-history">Fluid History</a></h4>
<p>History will go in about the same way it did in the real world, though some of the details may change. As long as the end results of the large events work out about the same, all is well. Things that would drastically change history, like new technologies, tend to just end up forgotten rather than realizing their potential. This is the default assumption for Spirit of the Century.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#id927" id="ahistorical" name="ahistorical">Ahistorical</a></h4>
<p>Once the game begins, history is your canvas to write upon. Left to its own devices, history will unfold roughly as you’d expect it to, but the adventures of the heroes and their opponents have the potential to change history into something else entirely.</p>

<p>If you’re well and truly playing SotC as a pick-up game, probably one of the
biggest problems you run the risk of smacking into is the difficulty of picking
stunts on the fly.</p>
<p>In general, we’ve tried to present the stunts in a way that makes it easy to
look for your concept first, at a high level, with the categories under each
skill that we’ve divided the stunts into.</p>
<p>But even this isn’t really a <em>recommendation</em> from us on what to take, just a
selection aid, so we’d like to go one step further here and offer you sets of
recommended stunt picks, in blocks of two, three, four, and five, to make it
easier to quickly nail down a set of stunts that fit a particular concept.</p>
<p>Stunts work best when they’re married to the skills you’ve decided to put at or
close to your apex, so these packages are organized, as with several things in
this book, in terms of skills.</p>
